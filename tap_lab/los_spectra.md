MEMORANDUM FOR SpaceWERX (DoD STTR 2025.D)

FROM:	SSC - SDA TAP Lab

SUBJECT:	Letter of Support for Phase I of SPECTRA (Sensor Processing at the Edge for Cognitive Threat Reconnaissance and Alert) addressing STTR Topic SF25D-T1201: Adaptive and Intelligent Space (AIS).

1.	The Space Domain Awareness (SDA) TAP Lab accelerates delivery of space battle management software to defense centers. We decompose adversary space kill chains into problem statements and invite industry, academia, and government to address them in 3‑month cycles. We are charged to field a prototype battle management system before the end of 2025.

2.	I am fully supportive of Interactive Aptitude LLC’s SPECTRA Phase I. Advanced edge‑AI sensor processing, multi‑modal fusion, and on‑board threat catalog capabilities are among the highest priorities for the SDA TAP Lab. Funding awards would help transition this capability into interim operations with the Joint Commercial Operations (JCO) cell or integrate into workflows at the National Space Defense Center (NSDC), enabling reconfigurable space architectures that provide adaptability and resiliency to the space mission.

3.	SPECTRA provides a critical enhancement to fill space domain awareness capability gaps. Specifically, by delivering a software‑defined, reconfigurable sensor‑compute (HPC‑S) payload that performs real‑time, uncertainty‑aware threat detection and triage at the edge; fuses multi‑modal observations with a cross‑modal Space EW Catalog; and standardizes modality‑agnostic, integration‑ready interfaces with prioritized “edge slices” for degraded‑link operations. Additionally, its on‑sensor alerts and concise evidence bundles reduce operator workload, improve custody via rapid cross‑modal tip‑and‑cue, and, when synchronized, update ground catalog services—accelerating integration with SDA TAP Lab publish/subscribe data flows and enabling repeatable evaluation against transition criteria. This aligns with SDA TAP Lab problem statements 15–18 and 31–35 and supports Welder’s Arc custody, characterization, and response workflows.
