CONCEPT: Crimson Shock is proliferated, target tracking sensor system consisting of a multi-modal sensor kit (UV, EO, IR, RF, & other) that will be deployed on air, land, and sea platforms. Each platform variant will have unique performance in terms of coverage, spectrum, and sensitivity. It will be controlled through a mesh of existing networks and protocols such as the Marine Corp Weapons Lab (MCWL) Tactical Edge Node: Man-Portable (TEN-MP), Link-16, Starlink, BCN, GCN, and others. The goal of the system, once deployed, is to rapidly reacquire, track, ID, and generate fire-control quality solutions to joint weapon systems - tailored for a family of low-altitude targets from ballistic missiles, hyper glide vehicles, and Very/Low Earth Orbit (V/LEO) satellites. Simply said, this enables Counter-C5ISRT for INDOPACOM missions.

PROOF-OF-CONCEPT: Cloudstone Innovations was awarded a Global Data Marketplace (GDM) order to demonstrate the proof of concept for the first land variant. The proof of concept will include multiple sensor phenomenologies such as UV, EO, IR, RF, and Event Cameras. They are responsible for non-recurring engineering and design work to establish modularity and interoperability standards which can be used for scaled production through SDA TAP Lab - Maui.

INTEROPERABILITY: Should focus on the various shared SWaP-C demands from multiple sensor payloads within the kit such as power supply, storage, compute, networking, thermal control, system orientation and pointing, etc.

MODULARITY: Should focus on the standards and abstractions required to ensure that a single sensor payload can be replaced quickly and reliably when new vendors, technologies, or enhancements are available. Example, replacing a SWIR sensor payload with a new camera make/model, or sub-contractor should NOT require any SWaP-C, interface, design or other CONOP changes.
