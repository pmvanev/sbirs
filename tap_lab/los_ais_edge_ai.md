MEMORANDUM FOR SpaceWERX (DoD STTR 2025.D)

FROM:	SSC - SDA TAP Lab

SUBJECT:	Letter of Support for Phase I of AIS Edge AI addressing STTR Topic SF25D-T1201: Adaptive and Intelligent Space (AIS).

1.	The Space Domain Awareness (SDA) TAP Lab accelerates delivery of space battle management software to defense centers. We decompose adversary space kill chains into problem statements and invite industry, academia, and government to address them in 3‑month cycles. We are charged to field a prototype battle management system before the end of 2025.

2.	I am fully supportive of Interactive Aptitude LLC’s AIS Edge AI Phase I. On‑board autonomy, certifiable update pathways, and resilient edge computing are among the highest priorities for the SDA TAP Lab. Funding awards would help transition this capability into interim operations with the Joint Commercial Operations (JCO) cell or integrate into workflows at the National Space Defense Center (NSDC), enabling reconfigurable space architectures that provide adaptability and resiliency to the space mission.

3.	AIS Edge AI provides a critical enhancement to fill space domain awareness capability gaps. Specifically, by delivering a hardware‑agnostic autonomy stack with reinforcement‑learning‑driven planning and scheduling; FPGA‑resident policy inference with secure weight updates; zero‑trust enclaves and a memory‑safe runtime; simulation/HIL pipelines and operator digests; and standards‑aware, modality‑agnostic interfaces (e.g., CCSDS/BM‑C2) that produce uncertainty‑aware summaries and concise evidence bundles for publish/subscribe integration. These capabilities reduce operator workload, improve custody and characterization through collaborative tip‑and‑cue, and enable repeatable evaluation against transition criteria.
