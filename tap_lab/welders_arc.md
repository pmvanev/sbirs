Welder's Arc

    This is the Lab’s automated battle management system that provides warfighters resiliency and support to Joint Commercial Operations (JCO)
    and extended international partners and unclassified levels.
        Design, testing and hardening of a scalable platform layer that enables modular integration across all SDA TAP Lab cohort members.
        Enancement of APIs, standardization of message formats and integration with message brokers to enable full-scale M2M automation; enabling functionality as a single integrated battle management
        Continued refinement, tuning and further automation using AI/ML to ensure more robust identification of hostile behaviors and response recommendations within seconds.
