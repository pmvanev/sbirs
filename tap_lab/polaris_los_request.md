POLARIS (Platform for Operational Lifecycle, Algorithmic Research, and Integration in SDA-Operations) directly addresses SDA TAP Lab’s need for a validated simulation environment that supports threat simulation catalogs, satellite bus and payload modeling, and high-fidelity scenario generation. By combining the Basilisk astrodynamics framework with real-world sensor data, automated scoring, and standardized interfaces, POLARIS delivers a cost-effective, repeatable environment for algorithm testing and transition.
 
Within the kill chain, POLARIS strengthens custody, characterization, maneuver, and response. It has already demonstrated autonomous custody-driven scheduling of RSOs using reinforcement learning agents trained under realistic spacecraft dynamics and operational constraints. Building on this foundation, the environment will support simulation of maneuver and proximity events to advance maneuver pattern of life, proximity characterization, and hostile intent assessment with response recommendations.
 
POLARIS will also contribute to TAP Lab exercises. For Welder’s Arc, it will provide a standardized arena where candidate algorithms are integrated and scored across multi-domain custody and characterization scenarios. For Victus Haze, it will support launch-on-demand custody rehearsals, testing how rapidly operators and algorithms adapt to new objects and changing orbital geometries. For Crimson Shock, its secure, IL-4 compliant cloud sandbox will allow algorithms to be evaluated under cyber-stressed and degraded-comms conditions, providing decision-quality evidence of resilience.
