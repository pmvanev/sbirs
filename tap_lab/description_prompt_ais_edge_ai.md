AIS Edge AI directly addresses SDA TAP Lab’s need for resilient, certifiable on‑board autonomy by bringing a hardware‑agnostic autonomy stack to the edge: reinforcement‑learning‑driven planning and scheduling, edge‑resident policy inference with secure weight updates, zero‑trust enclaves with a memory‑safe runtime, and simulation/HIL pipelines with standards‑aware, modality‑agnostic interfaces (e.g., CCSDS/BM‑C2). The result is uncertainty‑aware summaries and concise evidence bundles suitable for publish/subscribe integration even under degraded or contested links.

Within the kill chain, AIS Edge AI strengthens custody, characterization, maneuver, and response. It reduces decision latency by executing mission‑aware scheduling and collaborative tip‑and‑cue on‑orbit, preserves mission utility under constrained comms, and enables certifiable on‑orbit updates that keep autonomy aligned with current TTPs—lowering operator workload while improving decision quality.

For TAP Lab exercises, AIS Edge AI integrates cleanly with existing workflows. For Welder’s Arc, it provides standardized pub/sub digests and evidence bundles (provenance, uncertainty, timing) that slot into custody/characterization/response scoring. For Crimson Shock, it offers standards hooks and on‑board inference that integrate with the multi‑modal sensor kit, maintaining function during degraded links and syncing updates when connectivity permits.
