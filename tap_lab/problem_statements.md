## SDA TAP Lab Problem Statements (Source: https://sdataplab.org/)

1. Launch Period of Interest (POI) — Automatically detect the start of a space launch cycle to define a Period of Interest (PoI). Early detection allows more time to assess potential threats and prepare appropriate responses. The capability must identify visual indicators suggestive of pre-launch activity, predict the associated launch window, and assign probabilistic confidence levels to segments of that window based on weather constraints and modeled launch opportunities (e.g., direct-ascent or coplanar trajectories).
2. Launch Commit Criteria — Automatically predict whether future weather conditions will meet space launch commit criteria. This enables timely go/no-go assessments and improves threat and hostility evaluations, especially when launch attempts deviate from expected weather tolerances. The capability must ingest global weather data, evaluate critical factors such as wind, temperature, humidity, cloud cover, precipitation, and lightning risk, and generate go/no-go predictions at 1, 3, and 6-hour intervals.
3. Direct Ascent ASAT Prediction — Automatically predict the time and azimuth of potential anti-satellite (ASAT) launches and assess the feasibility of engagement against the potential target(s). The capability must identify the likely targeted satellite, estimate remaining time of flight, and compute expected miss distances to support timely threat characterization. This predictive capability is essential for enabling defensive countermeasures, threat attribution, and rapid operational response to emerging space-based hostilities.
4. Coplanar Launch Prediction — Predictively identify launch windows and azimuths that enable insertion into a coplanar orbit within ±3° inclination with designated satellites. The capability must analyze inclination and RAAN alignment constraints to provide early warning of when adversaries may attempt to place vehicles in orbits capable of intercepting or shadowing friendly space assets.
5. Co-orbital Maneuver Prediction — Predictively model the sequence of orbital maneuvers required for a coplanar satellite to become co-orbital with a designated list of satellites. The capability must automatically provide early threat identification when an object maneuvers to match the orbit of high-value space assets.
6. Ascent Trajectory Prediction — Automatically predict the ascent trajectory of a launch vehicle from liftoff through orbital insertion. The capability should ingest launch alerts, reference vehicle parameters from a target model database, and constrain possible trajectories with historical and performance data. The capability must output trajectories in formats such as TLEs, state vectors, or ephemeris, and continuously refine predictions with updated detection inputs. This capability supports time-sensitive sensor search and reacquisition during sparse data conditions and must operate fully autonomously without user interaction.
7. Launch Nominal — Automatically predict the initial orbital parameters (Launch Nominals) of a space launch vehicle by ingesting launch prediction or detection messages, leveraging vehicle-specific parameters from a target model database, and applying constraints based on historical launch behavior. The capability must continuously refine outputs based on updated detections, coplanar/co-orbital opportunities, and mission-specific context. Outputs should include predicted orbital elements for use in coarse sensor search operations during early post-launch phases when tracking data is limited.
8. Associate Launch Nominals to PAI — Automatically associate predicted launch orbits (Launch Nominals, represented as TLEs) with publicly available open-source information including NOTAMs, TFRs, sea lane closures, FCC filings, and press releases to refine the Launch Period of Interest (POI). The capability must ingest and geospatially process polygonal data from these sources, align them with launch vehicle ground tracks and expected stage separation/reentry zones, and estimate launch times and locations. This improves accuracy and situational awareness when official data is sparse or delayed.
9. Detect Launches — Automatically detect foreign space launch events by processing data from seismic, acoustic, and kinetic sensors. The capability must identify and correlate relevant signals to determine the time and location of launch, associate multiple detections to a single event, and estimate an initial ascent trajectory.

11. Launch Pattern of Life (PoL) — Generate and maintain a launch pattern-of-life (POL) for each country, space launch facility, and space launch vehicle.
12. Fused Launch Detection — Automatically fuse multiple launch detection messages by associating them with a single unique launch event. The capability must iteratively refine and update launch confidence, estimated time, and location, while superseding previously published detection outputs. This enables dynamic solution improvement and ensures the most accurate, up-to-date characterization of launch activity.
13. Launch Threat Evaluation — Automatically assess whether a detected space launch represents a potential threat to friendly satellites by evaluating its trajectory for characteristics of direct ascent ASAT, coplanar, or co-orbital missions. The capability must identify potential targets, calculate remaining time of flight, and determine miss distance and probability of collision. This supports real-time threat warning, space asset defense, and attribution of hostile actions.
14. Detect Objects Transiting Atmosphere — Automatically detect, localize, and track high-velocity objects transiting the upper atmosphere (30–300 km altitude) using non-traditional data sources such as ionospheric disturbances, SATCOM/GPS interference patterns, and SDR-based signal anomalies. The capability must differentiate space-capable objects such as hyperglide vehicles and ballistic missiles from conventional aircraft, associate multiple detections into a coherent track, estimate trajectory vectors, and predict impact point and timing for Earth-bound events. Outputs enable cueing and enhance situational awareness using publicly accessible or commercially available data.
15. Sensor Search — Optimize sensor search strategies applicable to EO, IR, RF, and Radar sensors (ground and space-based) to maximize the probability of reacquiring a target while minimizing time spent searching. The algorithm must account for the target’s last known state and uncertainty, maneuverability characteristics (e.g., thrust and acceleration), and sensor constraints such as field of regard, field of view, environmental conditions, and minimum detectable target thresholds.
16. Search to Track Transition — Provide a transition algorithm that enables sensors to move from search mode to track mode while maximizing the probability of correctly identifying and locking onto the intended target. The technique must distinguish between valid detections and unintended objects, reducing the risk of tracking false targets. This prevents wasted sensor resources, mitigates the loss of custody, and preserves decision-making time in time-sensitive or contested operational environments.
17. Uncorrelated Track (UCT) Processing — Provide an advanced processing technique to analyze uncorrelated tracks (UCTs) and promote candidate orbits of space objects that may be actively managing their radar or optical signatures to evade detection, tracking, and identification. The capability must distinguish between cleanup debris, large piece separations, and potential threats, and maintain a historical database of intermediate orbits (e.g., GEO transfers). It should support correlation, orbit determination, metadata labeling, and integration into test/training pipelines. Special attention should be given to shadow tracks, high angular rates, and anomalous low-altitude signatures. This capability is critical for reacquiring and maintaining custody of potentially hostile space objects in a contested space domain.
18. State Update — Automatically perform state estimation and orbit determination by associating observations, correlating tracks to existing orbits, and applying techniques such as Batched Least Squares for orbit correction. The capability must maintain an up-to-date "mega catalog" of satellite states, propagate them to a common time, and perform cross-catalog correlation (e.g., ELCOMP) to identify duplicate entries, assign aliases, and update records accordingly. This persistent and accurate state maintenance is essential to enable advanced space domain awareness operations.
19. Object Classification — Automatically classify detected objects as either active payload, inactive payload, upper stage, or apogee kick motor.
20. Threat Simulation Catalog — Continuously update a catalog of simulated or hypothetical orbital elements (e.g., TLEs, state vectors, ephemerides) representing potential space object maneuvers, separation events, or breakups. This Threat Simulation Catalog must be accessible by sensors to assist with tactical correlation of uncorrelated tracks (UCTs), enable automated alerting when real-world data matches simulated profiles, and support UCT seeding, sensor volume tasking, and hostility assessment. The capability should enable rapid integration of simulated cases to improve detection and characterization of adversarial activity in the space domain.
21. Detect Maneuvers — Automatically detect orbital maneuvers by identifying deviations from predicted state estimates or by correlating with entries in a Threat Simulation Catalog. The capability must assess the likelihood that a deviation is due to intentional maneuvering rather than environmental factors (e.g., drag or space weather), and accurately estimate the new orbital state. This enables early detection of engagement activity, providing critical time for operational response and defensive measures.
22. Characterize Maneuvers — Automatically characterize detected satellite maneuvers by classifying them into magnitude bands (e.g., small, medium, large, aggressive) and duration categories (short vs. long).

24. Detect Separation Events — Automatically detect satellite separation events by identifying increases in track density within a given orbital volume. The capability must classify events based on object size, generate and track debris families, backpropagate to identify the parent satellite, and estimate the event’s time and ECI location. Accurate classification of events as sub-satellite deployments or debris-producing incidents is essential for understanding system failures, collisions, or potential hostile actions such as kinetic attacks or covert weapon deployment.
25. Characterize Separation Events — Automatically classify detected debris-generating events into categories based on inferred energy levels: shedding (low-energy), explosions (medium-energy), or impacts (high-energy).

Predicting proximity events in advance is essential for space domain awareness, anomaly detection, and the assessment of potential threats or intelligence-gathering activity.
28. Characterize Proximity Events — Automatically characterize proximity events between satellites into behavioral categories such as flyby, formation flying, perch, teardrop, dynamic station keeping (DSK), walking safety ellipse, or non-maneuvering conjunctions (NMC).

34. Characterize Attitude Change — Characterize satellite attitude changes by distinguishing between unstable motion, deliberate reorientation, and mechanical configuration changes involving external components (e.g., antenna slewing, robotic arm activity, or cargo bay operations). This improves understanding of satellite behavior and intent.
35. Attitude Pattern of Life (PoL) — Generate and maintain pattern-of-life profiles for satellite attitude changes, encompassing both the spacecraft bus orientation and dynamic payload components such as gimbaled antennas, articulated appendages, or robotic elements.

46. Sensor Orchestration — Generate an advanced sensor orchestration system capable of dynamically modeling sensor capabilities including field of view, field of regard, slew/settle rates, exclusion zones, and detection thresholds and optimizing tasking schedules across a heterogeneous sensor network. The system must resolve conflicting cues based on data provenance and cue quality, maintain red/blue object lists and risk maps (e.g., weapon engagement zone thresholds), and calculate custody status and positive identification/confident identification (PID/CID) in real time. Custody metrics should incorporate sensor integration time, MDT thresholds, gap times, and delta-V estimates. The orchestration system must support multiple operational modes, including surveillance, custody, characterization, and threat warning & assessment, to maintain strategic situational awareness and support timely decision-making in contested space environments.
47. Camouflage, Concealment, Deception, Maneuver (CCDM) Evaluation — Generate analytical techniques and automated tools to evaluate space objects for indicators of camouflage, concealment, deception, or maneuver (CCDM). The capability must assess behavioral, kinematic, electromagnetic, and regulatory anomalies including deviations in stability, maneuver and RF pattern-of-life, sub-satellite deployment, registry violations, unexpected signatures, proximity activity, launch manifest discrepancies, and association with known threat vectors. These indicators, derived from historical threat intelligence, must be synthesized into a triage framework that alerts operators to objects potentially acting as space-based weapons or force enhancement capabilities. Integration with UCT detection, especially in GEO, is required to support real-time threat characterization and battle manager decision support.
48. Dynamic Red OOB — Generate an automated process to manage a Red List of space objects seamlessly adding, removing and updating the rank of objects as appropriate based on the evaluation of camouflage, concealment, deception, and maneuver (CCDM) indicators. The capability must determine when a minimum set of indicators signals a credible threat, identify which indicators are incomplete, map those gaps to appropriate sensor capabilities, and dynamically task sensors to collect the necessary data. This enables continuous refinement of the Red List to support timely threat detection.

These derived parameters support the identification of anomalous or threatening objects (e.g., weapons systems, nuclear materials, rapid mass loss) and inform weapon engagement zones.
50. Satellite Payload Modeling — Generate techniques to model satellite payload characteristics such as sensor or weapon type (e.g., EO, IR, RF, radar, DE, munition), aperture or dish size, sensitive wavelengths, and maximum delta-V for munitions using open-source information, observed satellite behavior, and novel analysis methods.
51. Target Model Database — Generate a dynamically updated Target Model Database (TMDB) that serves as a centralized digital repository of current satellite bus and payload models. The TMDB must support real-time queries by downstream services, handle information requests when data is outdated, incomplete, or low confidence, and allow third-party analytic providers to both retrieve and contribute data. The capability must include logic to manage and reconcile conflicting inputs, merging competing results from multiple providers to maintain data integrity and ensure the highest-confidence characterization of orbital targets.
52. Hostile Intent Assessment — Automatically assess the intent of observed satellite behaviors and space events, classifying them as hostile, potentially hostile, or non-hostile.

53. Response Recommendation — Provide an automated decision support capability that generates dynamic defensive response recommendations based on predicted weapon engagement opportunities, hostile intent assessments, conflict stage, Standing Rules of Engagement (SROEs), commander’s intent, and evaluated risks or vulnerabilities. The capability must structure recommended courses of action into a hierarchy of mission objectives (e.g., Do Nothing, Monitor, Mitigate, Evade, Attribute, or Assess) and continuously refine or supersede these recommendations as new data becomes available.
54. Combat Assessments — Perform the following assessments: hostility, strike, munitions effectiveness, battle damage, collateral damage. Strike assessment (often termed post-strike assessment) refers to the immediate evaluation of a strike’s outcome, usually conducted by operations personnel in near real-time. Its purpose is to quickly measure whether the strike achieved its intended performance against the target, providing an initial sense of success or failure. Battle damage assessment (BDA) is to provide commanders with timely, accurate estimates of what happened to the target – essentially, did the strike achieve the desired effect on the target’s capabilities. Collateral damage assessment (CDA) addresses the unintended or incidental effects of military strikes, particularly harm to civilians and damage to civilian objects or other non-combatant entities. Munitions Effectiveness Assessment (MEA) is the component of combat assessment that evaluates how well the weapons or munitions employed performed and whether they functioned as expected.
