SPECTRA (Sensor Processing at the Edge for Cognitive Threat Reconnaissance and Alert) directly addresses SDA TAP Lab needs for real‑time, resilient space EW awareness by bringing AI to the edge for on‑sensor detection, triage, and explanation of electromagnetic threats. Its software‑defined, reconfigurable sensor‑compute (HPC‑S) payload standardizes modality‑agnostic interfaces and carries prioritized “edge slices” so that uncertainty‑aware alerts and concise evidence bundles are generated and delivered even under degraded or contested links.

Within the kill chain, SPECTRA strengthens detection, characterization, and response by: (a) detecting RF link changes and emissions anomalies on‑orbit; (b) fusing complementary signals with a cross‑modal Space EW Catalog to reduce false alarms; and (c) publishing decision‑quality, time‑critical alerts that tip‑and‑cue other assets. This reduces custody gaps and operator workload while accelerating battlespace understanding.

For TAP Lab exercises, SPECTRA integrates cleanly with existing workflows. For Welder’s Arc, it provides standardized pub/sub alerts and evidence bundles (provenance, uncertainty, timing) for custody, characterization, and response. For Victus Haze, it delivers rapid, downlink‑efficient EW observations and alerts under constrained comms to accelerate launch‑on‑demand custody rehearsals. For Crimson Shock, it aligns with the multi‑modal sensor kit via modality‑agnostic interfaces and edge processing, maintaining function during degraded links and syncing catalog slices when connectivity permits.
