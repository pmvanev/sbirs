## Analysis: What You'd Actually Build

### The Core Problem
Soldiers operating in Chemical and Biological (CB) contaminated environments face information overload. They're wearing restrictive protective gear (MOPP suits, M50 respirators), carrying multiple CB sensors, and need to share real-time sensor data with their team and command post to make rapid, life-or-death decisions.

### What You'd Build

You'd develop a **real-time data visualization and sharing system** for CB operations. This could take several forms:

#### Hardware Options:
- **Head-mounted display** (like AR glasses) that works WITH the M50 respirator
- **Wrist-worn device** for quick glances
- **Handheld tactical display**
- Novel integration using **holographic/diffractive waveguide technology** in polycarbonate lenses

#### Software Requirements:
- Real-time sensor data aggregation from multiple CB detection devices
- Visualization interface showing contamination levels, threat zones, safe routes
- Multi-user data sharing (soldier-to-soldier and soldier-to-command)
- Must integrate with **TAK (Tactical Assault Kit)** - the military's standard tactical mapping system
- Must follow **ISA (Integrated Sensor Architecture)** standards
- Secure, compliant with DISA security guidelines

### Concrete Use Case Example
Two soldiers in full MOPP gear conducting a Sensitive Site Exploitation. They're each carrying 3-4 different CB sensors (chemical detectors, biological samplers, radiation monitors). Currently, they can't physically look at all the readouts while moving. Your system would:

1. **Collect** data from all sensors wirelessly
2. **Visualize** the combined threat picture on their HUD/wrist display/device
3. **Share** that same data in real-time with their partner and command post
4. **Alert** them to threats without requiring them to look down at individual devices

### Phase Deliverables

#### Phase I (~$200K, 6 months):
- Proof of concept prototype
- Design specifications (functional, physical, environmental, software)
- SWAP requirements and form factor analysis
- Integration plan with existing DoD systems
- Phase II development plan

#### Phase II (~$1.1M, 2 years):
- Working pre-production prototype
- Core features and performance developed
- Field testing in realistic conditions
- Performance validation (speed, accuracy, throughput, response time)
- Testing at integration events for durability and user acceptance

#### Phase III (follow-on):
- Full ruggedization and operational testing
- User manuals and training materials
- Support for demonstrations
- Transition Agreement support

### Key Technical Challenges
- Working with M50 respirator constraints
- Minimizing cognitive overload (HUDs can cause eye strain, motion sickness)
- Meeting battlefield eyewear safety standards
- SWAP (Size, Weight, and Power) constraints
- Real-time data transmission in tactical networks
- Security and ITAR compliance
- Integration with existing CB sensors and detection equipment

### Dual Use Applications
The technology has strong commercial potential:
- **Aviation:** Real-time data visualization for commercial pilots
- **Emergency Services:** Firefighters and police visualizing building layouts, routes, suspect information, or sensor data (oxygen/carbon monoxide)
- **Manufacturing:** Projecting instructions and diagrams for efficient assembly while keeping hands free
- **Any critical decision-making role** requiring real-time data visualization across multiple users

## Topic Details from Solicitation

### Objective
A tactical tool or capability to increase situational awareness and enhance decision support of Warfighters operating in Chemical and Biological (CB) contested environments. The innovative technology proposed should work within Human Machine Interface (HMI) concepts to provide significant advantage compared to its size, weight, and power (SWAP) demands. This may include tactical augmented reality, sensor visualization solutions, or unique end user device/materials solutions.

### Description
Joint Warfighters are increasingly required to rapidly process volumes of complex information from diverse sources to maintain operational effectiveness in dynamic environments. Operating in CB contested environments imposes additional challenges such as restrictive personal protective equipment, specialized equipment requirements, and high risk/time sensitive nature of the mission. The CBD SBIR Program is seeking an innovative capability to increase the efficient integration, visualization, and communication of tactical data to increase situational awareness and enhance decision-making on the battlefield. The proposed solution may be in the form of a novel tactical end user device or an enhancement to current kit.

For example, Heads Up Displays (HUD) in the tactical environment intend to deliver Warfighters critical information directly to their field of view, with the intent to keep 'heads up and on the fight'. However, implementing HUDs tactically also present challenges such as decreased field of view, motion sickness, eye strain, and cognitive overload. Implementing HUDs while wearing a M50 respirator quickly also exacerbates the physical strain and minimizes the HUDs effectiveness.

Other technologies that have seen success in the public sector include holographic diffractive waveform technology utilizing ingrained diffractive gratings within a lens for image visualization. General non-holographic diffractive waveguide technology has seen success as well, though with lower image and color quality. The integration of these technologies, potentially of waveguide into polycarbonate, and in general to CB kit and mission space is of interest.

The proposed solution may be head borne, wrist worn, handheld, or other, but must be specific to enhancing the CB mission. Picture two Soldiers executing a Sensitive Site Exploitation in MOPP and carrying more CB sensors than they can hold in their hands between them. The goal is to create a solution so that each of the Soldiers as well as command post receive the same sensor data in real time to make a rapid and informed tactical decision.

The proposed solution must be adaptable to various CB applications and use with Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) kits. Any head borne solutions must integrate with a variety of respirators, to include the M50, and must adhere to battlefield eyewear safety guidelines. Additional hardware considerations include physical connections, network stack and operating system, data transmission, and any non-standard characteristics.

Additionally, any software must be built to Integrated Sensor Architecture (ISA) standards and comply with the current version of the Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) Software Development Kit (SDK). Additional software considerations include the hardware requirements for the software, installation and configuration, user interface and experience, and network connections. Software development should also be advised by DISA Application Security and Development STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guide).

### Technical Requirements

#### Hardware (if applicable):
- SWAP requirements and specifications
- Form factor, materials, finish, hardening
- Mounting and interface specifications
- Integration with M50 respirator and MOPP gear

#### Software (if applicable):
- Built to ISA (Integrated Sensor Architecture) standards
- TAK (Tactical Assault Kit) SDK compliance
- DISA Application Security and Development STIG compliance
- User interface specifications
- Proposed APIs
- Configuration management
- Security considerations

## Q&A from Solicitation

**Q: Is an innovative, software-only CBD visualization solution that may be implemented on a variety of new and existing display/headset systems such as IVAS responsive to this topic?**

A: Yes. This would be an appropriate technical approach to the topic.

**Q: Is this topic intended to focus predominantly on building a visualization suite for an existing hardware tool? Or is it expected that the proposer will develop their own novel technology for the detection that the visualization suite will interact with?**

A: This topic is written with the intent to encompass multiple varieties of solutions within the CBD mission space. We do not have a singular firm or existing tool in mind and are looking to see what novel technologies and solutions firms can deliver.
