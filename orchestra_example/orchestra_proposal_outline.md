## ORCHESTRA-AI Proposal — Outline and Mapping Summary

### Executive Summary (What this proposal does)
- Proposes an AI-enabled battle rhythm management platform for theater-level planning centers to improve decision pacing, handoffs, and resilience across five operational tempo phases (deliberate, ramp-up, surge, crisis, cooldown).
- Core subsystems: RhythmBridge (adaptive checklist/tasking), TempoAlign-AI (cadence modulation), ContextTriager (mission-phase-aware triage), AdaptiveOps Interface (role/tempo-aware UI), RhythmSim-AI (tempo stress simulation).
- Validates feasibility in Phase I via simulation, synthetic data, UI walkthroughs, and metrics tied to pacing, cognitive load, and turnover clarity. Targets integration with USW-DSS and shore-based C2.

### Section-by-Section Outline
1) Front Matter
- Volume and Title: "Volume 2: Technical Volume"; Title: "ORCHESTRA-AI: Operational Rhythm Coordination & Handoff Engine for Strategic Tasking & Real-time Adaptation".

2) 1.0 Description of Proposed Phase I Technical Effort
- Problem: Fragmented data, async updates, minimal shift-transition support overwhelm staff; static tools fail under tempo changes; cognitive overload harms COA quality.
- Scenario: Strategic Pulse Management Across Operational Planning Centers.
- Proposed Solution (five innovations):
  - RhythmBridge: dynamic coordination/checklist backbone.
  - TempoAlign-AI: cadence modulation based on risk/workload/role.
  - ContextTriager: transformer-based prioritization by mission phase.
  - AdaptiveOps Interface: role/tempo-aware UI to simplify turnover.
  - RhythmSim-AI: rhythm stress forecasting and mitigation.
- Figures/Tables: Figure 1 (system architecture). Table 1 (degree of innovation). Table 2 (topic alignment).
- Team: DARPA program experience; goal is a Phase I proof-of-concept reducing cognitive burden and improving COA timeliness/quality.

3) 1.01 Technical Approach
- Integrated, modular architecture ingesting ISR/readiness/plans/environmental data and battle rhythm calendars.
- Subsections (each with challenge + DoI):
  1. RhythmBridge — tempo-adaptive checklist and sync tracking (Figure 2); addresses loss of continuity during tempo shifts.
  2. TempoAlign-AI — models operational tempo and cognitive load to modulate sync frequency.
  3. ContextTriager — transformer-based multi-source fusion aligned to doctrinal phases and commander intent.
  4. AdaptiveOps Interface — dynamically modulates UI complexity by role/phase/load (Figure 3 references COMMANDER-AI TRL 2–3 demo).
  5. RhythmSim-AI — simulates tempo stress, forecasts rhythm collapse, recommends mitigations.

4) 1.02 Alignment with Topic Requirements
- Table 2 maps topic requirements to solution elements (AI/ML rhythm management; checklist tasking; adaptability across phases; turnover/continuity; operator-centric UI; multi-source SA; offline resilience; unclassified Phase I; IA/classified readiness; transition/integration readiness).

5) 1.03 Data, Evaluation, & Metrics
- Synthetic datasets; per-component metrics and success criteria.

- Objective 4: AdaptiveOps Interface — role/phase/load adaptive UI; turnover clarity.
- Objective 5: RhythmSim-AI — model/forecast rhythm stress and actionable cues.
- Objective 6: Integrated Feasibility and Security Readiness Review — integrated simulations; initial cybersecurity docs.
