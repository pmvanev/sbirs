OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this topic is to develop a low-cost, low size, weight, and power (SWaP) radar warning receiver (RWR) for integration on small satellite platforms operating in geostationary orbit (GEO). The RWR must provide reliable indications and warnings (I&W) by detecting and characterizing radar emissions in support of space domain awareness (SDA) missions. The system must be capable of surviving launch and operating in the harsh space environment, supporting onboard data processing, and securely communicating results to host platforms and ground systems. The RWR should be designed for ease of integration with common spacecraft bus standards (mechanical, thermal, electrical, and data) to enable rapid proliferation across United States Space Force (USSF) space assets.

DESCRIPTION:
The space domain is becoming increasingly congested, contested, and competitive, demanding that the USSF continuously improve its ability to achieve and maintain space superiority. A key enabler of this superiority is space domain awareness (SDA) which is the ability to detect, track, and characterize objects and activities in space in near-real-time. While ground-based sensors play a critical role in SDA, their effectiveness is inherently limited by line-of-sight, atmospheric interference, and coverage constraints. To overcome these limitations, space-based sensing capabilities are required to complement and enhance the existing architecture. However, many current space-based sensing solutions are large, power-intensive, and prohibitively expensive, making them difficult to deploy widely, particularly on small satellite platforms.
This topic seeks to develop and demonstrate a low-cost, low size, weight, and power (SWaP) radar warning receiver (RWR) suitable for integration on small satellites operating in GEO. These RWRs will detect and characterize radar emissions and provide real-time threat indications and warnings, directly supporting SDA missions. Existing “exquisite” systems provide these capabilities but are often too large or costly for wide deployment. The goal is to enable rapid proliferation of I&W capabilities by creating compact, efficient RWR payloads that meet or exceed current performance benchmarks while minimizing resource consumption. The RWR must be able to:
-Survive launch and operate in the harsh GEO environment,
-Integrate with common spacecraft interfaces,
-Process and communicate actionable data in real-time to the host platform and ground systems,
-Meet cybersecurity and classified data handling requirements
By making advanced sensing capabilities accessible to small platforms, this effort will contribute to a more resilient, distributed space sensor network, improve real-time threat detection, and enhance overall space domain awareness for the USSF and its partners.
