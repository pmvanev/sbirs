3. Identification and Significance of the Problem or Opportunity
The United States Air Force and broader Department of the Air Force (DAF) urgently need an affordable, rapidly re-programmable Electronic Warfare (EW) framework that lets operators sense, understand, and dominate an increasingly congested Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS). The TRL3 Phase I-type feasibility work for SPECTRUM (Synchronized Platform for Electronic-Combat Threat Recognition and Unified Modeling) proved that a digital twin can ingest EWIRDB threat data, generate pulse-descriptor-word (PDW) libraries, and drive Software-in-the-Loop (SiL) RF receivers and emitters, all while supporting operator rehearsal, live mission monitoring, and after-action analytics. Building on those results, this Phase II effort will elevate SPECTRUM to TRL 5+ by simulating realistic threat models, containerized edge EW processors, and operator-ready dashboards that compress integration timelines from months to hours, by providing a digital twin simulation framework and user interface for experimenting with large-scale wargaming scenarios before deployment of autonomous asset C3 policies.
Our Phase II solution unifies five tightly-coupled innovations that are mapped to the OUSD Integrated Sensing and Cyber (IS&C) Critical Technology Area (CTA) and the Trusted AI & Autonomy CTA:
1.	Modular Onboard EW Software that turns low-SWaP SDRs and emitters into model-driven, auto-reprogrammable assets.
2.	Distributed Fusion powered by edge-optimized MEBN/PR-OWL reasoning that shares only compact belief updates, surviving spectrum congestion and comms loss.
3.	Decentralized Multi-Domain C3 based on our ARAKNID-derived planner and MINC adaptive network control, generating machine-to-machine Courses of Action across air, space, land, and maritime nodes.
4.	Digital-Twin Simulation Environment that switches seamlessly between nanosecond PDW fidelity and large-scale wargaming speed, supporting pre-/in-/post-mission use.
5.	Automated EW Threat-Model Management that converts intelligence derived threat EW models into validated JSON + PDW libraries and provides realistic test of AI C3/fusion policies.
Together, these five advances will transform today’s stove-piped EW workflows into a cohesive, open, and rapidly evolvable architecture, compressing training cycles, lowering operational risk, and giving commanders a scalable means to “sense, decide, and act” in the EMS at operational tempos.
Our cross-disciplinary team blends Air Force EW-flight-software expertise, DoD multi-modal fusion R&D, and proven commercial-scale AI deployment experience. Dr. James Vaccaro will lead the effort with 14 years as an AFRL C2 program manager; Mr. Chris Wheeler adds 18 years of large-scale software commercialization and simulation delivery; Dr. Eran Swears contributes 20 years of multi-modal fusion across 50+ DARPA programs; Mr. David Rawlins brings 37 years of GPU-accelerated EW-training code; and Mr. Matt Folsom ensures operator trust through mission-proven User Experience design.
 
Figure 3.1: SPECTRUM provides capabilities for: (1) Modular Onboard EW Software, including (2) Distributed Fusion and (3) Decentralized Multi-Domain C3. all able to be simulated pre-mission/in-mission/post-mission within a (4) Digital Twin Simulation Environment, while considering realistic (5) EW Threat Model Management.
A Customer Memorandum co-signed by AFRL/RVES Senior Computer Scientist Mr. John Beighle, RVES Branch Chief Dr. Tracey Bowen, and AFLCMC/HBY Chief of EW Engineering Mr. Michael Dostie (attached) confirms operational demand for SPECTRUM and commits their organizations to transition support. Their endorsement, coupled with our team’s TRL 3–9 track record and Platform One deployment expertise, positions SPECTRUM Phase II for on-schedule delivery and low-risk path to Phase III adoption by the Air Force Electronic Warfare Division and allied DOD programs.
Table 3.1: Technical Challenges and Innovations
Innovation	Challenge Addressed
1) Modular Onboard EW Software	Highly-specialized systems, data formats, and proprietary interfaces block rapid insertion of new sensors, waveforms, and algorithms.
Current stove-piped systems, data formats, and proprietary interfaces prevent rapid insertion of new sensors, waveforms, and algorithms; an open, model-based architecture is essential to achieve joint interoperability and smooth technology transitions. Existing SOSA-aligned SDR backplanes and vendor waveform libraries accelerate hardware swaps, but they still lack automated links from threat-model repositories to reprogrammable front ends, forcing labor-intensive re-programming at every new threat intelligence update. ,  We will demonstrate in simulation a Software-in-the-Loop representation for a modular EW processor/receiver/emitter open-architecture stack that is able to adaptively share threat intelligence and onboard C3/Cognitive-EW policies without the need to ground assets. This Modular Onboard EW Software will marry our TRL-5 EMoP intelligence-sourced EW threat model libraries with commercial open-source SDR SDKs (e.g., Ettus USRP X410), as well as agile emitter SDKs (e.g., Keysight N5193B UXG), and computation tuning capable of running on NVIDIA Jetson-class low-SWaP GPUs— all under a unified, model-driven control open API. The stack leverages our TRL-4 ground-domain SDR experience and TRL-5 onboard processing for ground robotics and spacecraft, while also integrating directly with our existing classified EW re-programming workflow at the Air Force EW Division within Robins AFB hardware-in-the-loop/open-air range (whose Chief of Engineering is a signatory supporting this effort).
2) Distributed Fusion	Real-time fusion of massive, multisource RF data across dispersed nodes is limited by spectrum-congestion and computing latency.
Ingesting, correlating, and exploiting congested military, commercial, and adversary RF emissions in real time is impeded by data-volume spectrum-congestion and computing latency, degrading situational understanding in contested EMS environments. State-of-the-art federated fusion frameworks rely on hierarchical Kalman filters and cloud–edge load balancing, but they still assume high-throughput backbones and struggle with uncertain data in adversarial EMS conditions. ,  We will deploy a decentralized Bayesian-semantic architecture that executes our MEBN/PR-OWL (Multi-Entity Bayesian Network Probabilistic Ontologies) reasoning on the edge-optimized IA Data Management Suite, allowing each node to reconcile heterogeneous observations locally while exchanging only compact belief updates, fully supporting distributed and ubiquitous sensors. This capability derives from our TRL-7 MEBN/PR-OWL engine and TRL-5 IA Data Management Suite, which we will containerize for low-SWaP tactical processors.
3) Decentralized Multi-Domain C3	Commanders lack an agile C3 engine that synchronizes sensing, comms, and EW effects across all domains in contested spectrum.
Operators lack a single, real-time picture or battle-management mechanism to synchronize sensing, EW, and cyber effects across air, space, ground, and maritime domains, limiting the force’s ability of “mass and maneuver” during EMS operations at the speed of relevance. Demonstrations such as ABMS aggregate data and offer chat-based tasking, yet they do not build machine-to-machine automated courses of action in contested RF conditions. ,  Our solution embeds the decentralized C2 engine behind TRL-9 ARAKNID (specifically our TRL-5 “ADP&E Planner” )  with the TRL-3 MINC network-control AI to generate, evaluate, and execute courses of action, in a decentralized and coordinated manner across domains of air, space, maritime, and land. The capability extends the operational TRL-9 ARAKNID fielding at NORAD/NORTHCOM and the TRL-3 MINC adaptive controller by adding EMSO ontologies and coordination of EW-specific information.
4) Digital Twin Simulation Environment	Today’s tools cannot deliver both pulse-level fidelity and mission-tempo speed for simulation, HITL/open-air testing, and training.
Commanders need simulations accurate enough for tactics development yet fast enough for hardware-in-the-loop, open-air, and wargaming use, where balancing pulse-level fidelity with run-time, hardware load, and usability remains a major hurdle. Frameworks such as AFSIM or MATLAB-based signal injectors model micro-second pulses but slow markedly once scenarios include many dynamic emitters and lack immersive visualization for operator assessment. ,  We will integrate TRL 3-6 OmniSim visualizer and simulation framework with our TRL-5 OmniSense sensor models and TRL-5 EMoP threat libraries to create a cloud-scalable digital twin simulation environment that includes two modes of operation: 1) 1st order approximations of EW effects for large-scale wargaming tests, and 2) seamless setting changes for nanosecond PDW simulations for select scenarios needing higher-fidelity analysis. The simulation envirronment will also support pre-mission activities (operators rehearse with virtual friendly/adversary agents and tune behaviors), in-mission activities (the digital twin infers agent states under degraded comms to maintain situational awareness), and post-mission reports (generating after-action reports with recommended behavior adjustments), all within the same architecture. The solution reuses validated components from OmniSim (TRL-6 cataloging), OmniSense (TRL-5 sensor plug-ins), and EMoP (TRL-5 pulse generation), containerized for modular laboratory, HITL, and open-air range deployment.
5) EW Threat Model Management	Curating, validating, and inserting dynamic, high-fidelity threat-emitter models from diverse intelligence feeds is labor-intensive and error-prone.
Present simulation and EW re-programming workflows within the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Space Force cannot exploit the many adversary EW state-machine models encoded in EWIRDB (DOD’s primary database for threat EW models), resulting in the inability to thoroughly simulate realistic threat scenarios and perform friendly asset re-programming. We’ve developed our TRL5 EMoP suite to automatically extract adversary EW emitter system data, states, links, and parameters, and provide the data in a JSON format easily accessible to other EW applications. We’ve also automatically converted our EW models into Pulse Description Words (PDWs) compatible with arbitrary-waveform generators, allowing for laboratory testing, hardware-in-the-loop testing, and IQ data generation. This work has been done at both the unclassified and classified levels, and this workflow will be leveraged to generate threat-accurate simulations for actionable end-user insights, within the SPECTRUM framework.
4. Justification of Proposed Solution Applicability to Identified Defense Needs
Our SPECTRUM framework directly advances the OUSD(R&E) Integrated Sensing and Cyber critical technology area (CTA), as well as a secondary CTA for Trusted AI and Autonomy. For the “Integrated Sensing and Cyber” CTA, as depicted in Figure 3.1, SPECTRUM unifies (1) Modular Onboard EW Software, (2) Distributed Fusion, and (3) Decentralized Multi-Domain C3—each exercised pre-mission, in-mission, and post-mission within a (4) Digital Twin Simulation Environment and governed by dynamic EW Threat Model Management—to deliver an open, model-driven architecture that senses, understands, and shapes the electromagnetic spectrum at operational timescales. For the “Trusted AI and Autonomy” CTA, the same innovations embed verifiable Bayesian-semantic reasoning at the edge, autonomously re-program EW nodes from digital-twin outputs, and synchronize machine-to-machine courses of action across domains, ensuring safe adaptation and resilience in contested environments. With the SPECTRUM software running on inexpensive commercial processors and open-standard radios/emitters, SPECTRUM will fit in everything from lab benches to small unmanned aircraft without pushing Air Force size, weight, power, or budget limits. SPECTRUM’s blend of deployable hardware and high-fidelity digital-twin simulation lets crews rehearse, refine, and validate electronic tactics in hours, then load the same proven software onto operational platforms for immediate use. Overall, SPECTRUM compresses integration and training timelines, lowers operational risk, and equips commanders with a scalable, interoperable means to sense, decide, and be successful during electromagnetic spectrum operations.
5. Non-Defense Commercial Solution
Our Phase II effort proposes research to take our SPECTRUM solution to TRL 5 by building on past projects (as summarized in the Related Work section) as well as two of our existing commercialized products, namely our TRL5 “ADP&E (Autonomous Dynamic Planning & Execution) Planner,” and our TRL3 “Human-on-the-Loop Explainability and Recommender System (HERS)”. Our ADP&E Planner (Figure 5.1) solves complex real-time adversarial planning scenarios and strategic planning under probabilistic outcomes, and has been demonstrated as a flexible AI service for 6+ applications including TRL9 multi-domain command and control via on ARAKNID. The “HERS System” is also able to provide clear and traceable explanations of the generated strategies and Courses of Action (CoAs), present diverse and meaningful alternatives, incorporate user feedback and preferences, and adapt to the users' needs, enabling decision-makers to build trust in the C2 system, make informed choices, and focus on evaluating the most relevant strategies to ensure an effective and timely response.

Interactive Aptitude, LLC is highly capable of meeting SPECTRUM Phase II goals and commercializing the solutions, as demonstrated by our related capabilities:

3.	Successful integration into customer use-cases: Our non-defense target markets for ADP&E/HERS technologies specifically are: disaster response and emergency management, environmental monitoring and conservation, aerospace companies, satellite operators, and logistics/supply chain management, where there is a growing demand for advanced multi-agent solutions, increased focus on situational awareness, and human-machine collaboration. Our team members have acquired revenue of $390k+ by integrating our related products, ADP&E Planner and HERS human-on-the-loop system, into three C2 platforms and two UxV platforms of customer businesses (Scientific Systems Company, Inc. and Raytheon BBN), resulting in achieving TRL5 and TRL3 for each respective solution. We have been able to successfully integrate our products into customer use-cases, both in their simulation research projects and small-scale prototype installations. Customers have been very satisfied with our implementations. As an example, Pat McLaughlin, Vice President of Innovation at SSCI, said that we have “assisted with countless challenging problems in the area of multi-domain command and control, including data fusion of multi-modal sensors, ML-trained dynamic planning, and wargame game theoretic approaches. The prototypes created have helped guide reliable software implementations and win multiple new contracts.”
The proposed SPECTRUM solution differs from similar competitor solutions in several key areas: 1) Resilient decentralized collaboration: Its MEBN/PR-OWL approach will enhance collaboration resilience in degraded/contested communication environments by employing iterative messaging and predictive modeling, while other approaches are not resilient during communications failures, due to requiring full consensus among collaborating assets; 2) Robust system management: The proposed SPECTRUM solution employs a bottom-up Bayesian Probabilistic Multi-Objective Analysis, which helps manage system/perception failures, sensor noise, and uncertainty, leading to efficient optimization of mission metrics; 3) Flexible Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs): The underlying ADP&E solution uses HTNs to allow for generalized, cross-domain reuse of UxV behaviors, making it adaptable across different industries and applications; and 4) Integrated Human-on-the-Loop processing: Unlike most competitors, our solution will incorporate a state-of-the-art Human-on-the-Loop interaction at the ground station, enabling end-users to add data and audit/override autonomous control.
The proposed SPECTRUMsolution has the following technical risks, and corresponding mitigation plans:
1.	Modularity & Scalability Risk: Achieving scalability across numerous diverse assets under varying mission conditions. Mitigation Plan: Develop SPECTRUM with a flexible and scalable structure that can support heterogeneous assets and scale to 2000+ multi-domain assets by using approaches such as implementing plug-and-play UxV integration through a microservice architecture and incorporating adaptive-load-balancing distributed computing techniques among UxVs and stations. Additionally, conduct thorough performance testing under various mission scenarios and workloads to enhance performance and resource usage.
2.	Communications & Computation Risk: Ensuring communication reliability in degraded/contested environments and addressing potential issues during planning computation due to the problem space's high dimensionality. Mitigation Plan: Implement offline and online learning to optimize communication availability, reduce latency, and minimize the total data transfer sizes needed per mission. Design and apply fast planning/coordination algorithms using software optimization methods, including heuristic-based/approximate calculations, thread-parallelization, and iterative solution refinement allowing even faster responses if needed.
3.	User Trust Risk: Gaining user trust, adoption, and acceptance of the system can be challenging due to the system's complexity and the end-user's demand for high reliability. Mitigation Plan: Establish end-user confidence in the C2 and Digital Twin systems by providing extensive training/support, offering explainable strategy/CoA details, maintaining full algorithmic traceability for in-depth troubleshooting, and conducting thorough testing/validation to ensure maximum reliability.
4.	Integration Risk: Integrating software with existing systems and platforms. Mitigation Plan: Employ government-approved software “Development, Security, and Operations” (DevSecOps) processes like PlatformOne. Develop robust APIs and interfaces within PlatformOne to enable seamless integration with various multi-domain assets and systems.
6. Proposed Adaptation of Non-Defense Commercial Solution
Our proposed SPECTRUM effort shall perform R/R&D to adapt two of our existing TRL 3-5 products to reach TRL 5, namely our “ADP&E Planner” and “Human-on-the-Loop Explainability and Recommender System (HERS)”. Our “ADP&E Planner” and “HERS System” will be modified to achieve SPECTRUM’s envisioned architecture  as seen in Figure 6.1. The proposed SPECTRUM solution does not currently have a commercially available competitor. There are several research directions within the DoD and commercial companies that are looking to solve subsets of the SPECTRUM solution (e.g. asset-specific autonomy, Digital-Twin frameworks for one platform type only, etc.). The SPECTRUM solution differs from competitor research directions in several key ways as detailed in Section 5, namely: providing more comprehensive collaboration, integrating the Digital-Twin within the autonomy architecture, providing a scalable and adaptable architecture, allowing for continuous improvement/integration, and built-in customizable/comprehensive training. 
 
Figure 6.1: DCC’s proposed government-open-source software architecture, including end-user interaction methods
We have performed similar modifications of the existing related products (ADP&E and HERS) for 2 commercial organizations, acquiring a revenue of $390k+ related specifically to these UxV Onboard-C3/Digital-Twin  technologies, as detailed in Section 5.
USAF-unique modifications through the proposed SPECTRUM program would not change the existing  ADP&E/HERS products’ essential uses and purposes, because the ADP&E/HERS products can be fully utilized, and expanded upon with add-on software/hardware packages to reach the functionality of the proposed SPECTRUM solution.
The SPECTRUM solution has differences in the production/manufacturing/delivery processes when comparing Government versus commercial customers, involving compliance, security, customization, IP, procurement, and support. We have experience with DoD contracts (per Section 17, “Related Work”), thus have experience in many of these process categories. Higher risk process categories are summarized within the risk/mitigation plan of Section 5. 
We expect the SPECTRUM solution to have significant quantitative benefits for USAF end-users. Through our implementation, we expect: enhanced strategic/tactical decision-making, increased adaptability in dynamic environments, reduced communication overhead, improved resource allocation, enhanced cross-domain coordination, greater trust and transparency in UxVs, and faster development/deployment. Achievement of these benefits will be ensured by optimizing our system design and algorithms to maximize the UxV team’s key metrics listed in Table 2. SPECTRUM's UxV team training metrics are compiled from the platform-level planner to the high-level planner. These metrics are then utilized within a "decentralized communication process" to determine the most effective task/asset combinations.
Table 6.1: Metrics to maximize during UxV team’s training prior to deployment, and during in-mission/adaptive retraining
Key Metric to Maximize [0.0–1.0]	Description
Success Rate	Probability of success, that the requested effect (e.g., find target, rescue target, etc.) is successful
Risk Aversion	Related to the likelihood of blue force asset detection, tracking, and attrition (combined weighted average, where weight is highest for attrition, followed by tracking and detection)
Mission Completion Timeliness	How close we can meet mission timing constraints (e.g., complete before time x, between time y and z, etc.); the metric falls exponentially as we stray further from the constraints
Communications Resilience	Probability of comms availability, total latency, and total data transfer sizes required; values determined/optimized during our comms-Spectral-Clustering planning cycle
Policy Waiver Avoidance	Related to the severity of violations the plan has to certain policies (e.g. overriding lower priority missions, entering prohibited airspace, etc.), where a waiver is required to continue
We will adapt existing related products (ADP&E Planner and HERS System) to fulfill USAF needs and to implement all features described in Figure 3.1 (SPECTRUM features), Table 3.1 (SPECTRUM’s unique solutions). More specifically, modifications will include: 1) upgrading the ADP&E Planner interfaces, platform-level DRL behaviors, and ADCOP decentralized collaboration communications, to follow ABMS operational paradigms and serve particular USAF platforms of interest, and 2) adapting our HERS System product to prototype the human-on-the-loop capability to add data and audit/override autonomous control of UxV groups, for specific USAF missions of interest.
During this Phase II effort we will perform Software-in-the-Loop Test & Evaluation (T&E), exercising the full SPECTRUM stack in a classified/unclassified digital-twin environment. The T&E campaign will verify: (1) threat-library management and use of the library to generate adversary EW state-machine behaviors including pulse-level and high-level data, (2) real-time MEBN/PR-OWL fusion, and (3) ADP&E course-of-action generation under imposed network loss. We will emulate SOSA-aligned USRP X410 and Keysight UXG devices with high-fidelity signal-models to drive timing-accurate SDR control paths, capture edge CPU/GPU loading, measure end-to-end latency, and fast COP updates to operators. Although no physical radios or emitters are integrated in this phase, all interfaces conform to open SOSA/FACE messaging profiles and RF device APIs, ensuring that subsequent hardware-in-the-loop and open-air events can reuse the validated software artifacts without code changes.
7. Phase I-Type “Feasibility Study” Results
IR&D efforts and non-SBIR/STTR have resulted in a set of results demonstrating feasibility of high-risk components of the proposed SPECTRUM technologies. 
The first set of high-risk components addressed relate to our proposed Digital Twin Simulation Environment. It is critical that the simulation matches realistic EW effects, for the simulation results to be useful. As a result, during our Phase I-Type “Feasibility Study” Results, we implemented a Digital-Twin-verification prototype as described in  including high-level components: 1) Data Processing: Of hardware output data to simulator’s format (e.g. S/N for AFSIM), via: filtering, normalization, compression, etc.; 2) M&S Tool Uncertainty Evaluation Engine: Calculates RMSE of simulation output data compared to normalized test data. Errors can occur from: 1) Test data processing errors and/or 2) Simulator calculation errors; 3) Increase accuracy simulation against test results: Via leveraging more accurate models from EWIR, etc.; 4) Radar Digital Twin: Allows for more agile changes/testing of parameters. More specifically, the flow depicted in Figure 7.1 was used for adversary ADC (Analog-to-Digital) data generation and simulation verification, resulting in the ability to track errors between true and simulated ADC results. Additionally, we developed our initial technique of organizing EWIRDB data outputs for representing realistic adversary EW models including state types (such as docked/undocked sequences, docked/undocked ele-mental states, switches, and interrupts) and complex sequences, as depicted the Related Work Section for the EMOP project (under non-SBIR/STTR funds). To further enhance usability, we developed a prototype website for end-user browsing, research, and visualization of adversary state machines, as shown in Figure 7.2. The prototype concept shows how we can quickly develop data summarizations and visualizations within a browser to explore various radars and parameters, depending on specific end-user needs. The website currently integrates state machine visualizations for example unclassified data, to demonstrate how users could conduct in-depth research within a unified interface. By offering customizable views and easy access to rel-evant information, the platform provides a prototype for how to enhance the ability of end-users to analyze EW threats effectively.
 
Figure 7.1: Adversary ADC (Analog-to-Digital) Data Generation and Simulation Verification
Building on our Phase I-type feasibility results, SPECTRUM Phase II will evolve the prototype toolchain into a cloud-deployable simulation environment that feeds real-time sensor, fusion, and C3 micro-services, support automated model-validation against live-range data, and expose open-APIs for easy future integration of these digital twins into hardware solutions. Concurrently, we will extend the adversary-state-machine browser into a fully integrated Threat Model Management portal that auto-generates pulse-descriptor libraries, pushes configuration updates to edge nodes, and closes the loop with the digital twin for continuous data fusion and C3– thereby delivering the complete SPECTRUM Phase II capability.

11. Commercialization Strategy
Company Information
Our organization's core competencies center on developing and implementing advanced multi-domain wargaming simulation frameworks that integrate realistic radar physics models with Electronic Warfare (EW) effects across air, space, ground, and maritime domains. We have successfully developed extensive radar analysis capabilities demonstrated through comprehensive dataset generation covering beam formation timing, state machine analysis, multi-object tracking performance, and measurement error characterization across 58+ different radar configurations. Our analysis framework includes detailed modeling of fence-mode radar operations, air/space target tracking capability, and enhanced emission subtype classifications. Interactive Aptitude LLC has a growing commercial track record, with $1.5M+ in subcontract AI C2 product sales over the past two years. Our approach includes: Conference Demonstrations, Strategic Alliances (agreements with prime contractors Raytheon Technologies and Huntington Ingalls Industries looking for AI C2 solutions), and Augmentation Plan (if specialized marketing depth is needed, we will retain consultants with prior SaaS exits). Per Section 17 (Related Work), and the listed federal contract funding amounts, our team has provided significant value to programs for customers within the Air Force, Space Force, AFRL and DARPA– where most of our programs have led to follow-on work due to the satisfaction of these customers. We also have experience assisting with the deployment of TRL9 ARAKNID software which is currently use for US-Canada missile defense C2 under NORAD/NORTHCOM– via our process of integrating the software into PlatformOne, achieving three Certificates to Field, and validating the software in 23 live multi-domain exercises.
Customer and Competition
Key Technology Objectives: Our multi-domain wargaming simulation framework addresses critical gaps in realistic EW training environments by providing physics-based radar modeling, adaptive fidelity scaling, and seamless hardware-in-the-loop integration capabilities that existing solutions cannot match.
Current Competition: Potential competitors include AGI/Ansys, L3Harris simulation divisions, Raytheon simulation tools, Lockheed Martin simulation environments, and various government laboratory simulation systems. Most existing solutions rely on simplified physics engines that lack the high-fidelity dynamics/electromagnetic modeling depth our approach provides.
Competitive Advantages: Our solution’s edge begins with a physics-based radar-model library covering 58 + validated configurations, delivering far more accurate EW-effects predictions than lookup-table simulators. It unifies radar and EW interactions across air, space, ground, and maritime assets, modeling cross-domain interference in a single environment.

15. Non-Defense Commercial Customers
Past Revenue for This Solution: Our team members have acquired revenue of $390k+ by integrating our related products, ADP&E Planner and HERS human-on-the-loop system, into three C2 platforms and two UxV platforms of customer businesses (Scientific Systems Company, Inc. and Raytheon BBN) – where SPECTRUM will build off existing software, lessons learned, and customer feedback to expand this core business into the EW software/hardware implementation space.
Near-Term Revenue-Generating Opportunities (18-24 mo.): In addition to Section 12’s promising “DOD Transition Path & Funding Outlook” for near-term revenue-generating opportunities, the following are near-term (18-24 mo.) non-defense opportunities—structured as commercial subcontracts augmenting existing industry solutions:
●	Honeywell Aerospace – $5 – 8 M subcontract
 Integrate SPECTRUM’s threat-library pipeline and SiL EW-digital-twin into Honeywell’s next-generation Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) certification rigs, accelerating GNSS-resilient flight-management upgrades for Boeing and Airbus production lines.
●	Airbus UpNext / Flightlab – $4 – 7 M subcontract
 Embed the SPECTRUM simulation environment in Airbus’s E3 (electromagnetic environmental effects) campaign to virtually stress-test Satcom, 5 G, and Wi-Fi 7 cabins on the A321XLR, reducing costly flight-test hours and de-risking certification.
●	Collins Aerospace ARINC Communications – $4 – 6 M subcontract
 Deploy SPECTRUM’s distributed-fusion engine within the ARINC Global Network Service labs to model coordinated jamming/spoofing against VHF voice and ACARS datalink, delivering a commercial certification toolkit for > 150 airline customers.
●	*Internal estimates derived from publicly disclosed spend on comparable RF-test and interference-mitigation efforts.
12-Month Commercial Pipeline Target: $3-6 M in booked non-defense revenue, with multi-year upside via annual subscriptions and library add-ons.
Why It’s Credible: Recent non-defense dollars already flow to the exact RF-digital-twin, spectrum-analytics, and interference-test capabilities that SPECTRUM will deliver, for example ~$28M/yr HawkEye 360 commercial sales (Market tracker Growjo pegs HawkEye 360’s annual revenue from space-borne RF-data and EW analytics at $28.4 million, illustrating healthy private-sector demand for commercial RF intelligence). There is also $7B+ in  anti-jamming & the RF-test market. 2023 industry reports size the anti-jamming systems market at $4.29 B and the RF test-equipment market at $3.40 B; combined, they exceed $7 B today and are forecast to more than double by 2032. (fortunebusinessinsights.com, snsinsider.com).
These concrete civil-space contracts, private-company sales, and robust market-size studies validate SPECTRUM’s target price points and sustained non-defense demand.
16. Investors and Partners
Formal Investors / Advisors: None at this time.  The company has not yet taken outside equity or appointed formal strategic advisors; Phase II will be executed with internal resources and SBIR funding.
Ongoing Collaborations Supporting Phase II:
●	George Mason University – C5I Center - Provides informal AI & secure-comms research support for anti-jamming modeling.
●	University of Colorado Boulder – AVS Lab - Supplies high-fidelity dynamics code and autonomy expertise to keep the simulation engine state-of-the-art.
