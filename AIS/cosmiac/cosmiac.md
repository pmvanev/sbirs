## COSMIAC (UNM) — Overview

Website: https://cosmiac.unm.edu/

COSMIAC is a Tier‑2 Research Center in the University of New Mexico School of Engineering focused on advancing aerospace and defense technologies via configurable and embedded systems, small satellites, advanced RF, radiation effects, and rapid/agile manufacturing. The center supports industry, government, and academia, with TS/SCI‑cleared personnel and 30,000 sq ft across cleanrooms, labs, and high‑bay space.

### Mission and Vision
- Mission: Provide a dynamic environment where faculty and students deliver technical engineering solutions aligned to evolving technologies.
- Vision: Be the nation’s center of excellence and specialized talent source for aerospace and defense solutions.
