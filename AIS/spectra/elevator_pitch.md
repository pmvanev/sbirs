SPECTRA (Sensor Processing at the Edge for Cognitive Threat Reconnaissance and Alert) is a software‑defined, reconfigurable sensor‑compute (HPC‑S) payload with multimodal sensor fusion at the edge and a cross‑modal Space EW Catalog that brings AI to the edge to detect, triage, and explain space electromagnetic threats in real time—even when links are contested. By standardizing modality‑agnostic, integration‑ready interfaces and carrying prioritized “edge slices” onboard, SPECTRA turns raw sensor streams into uncertainty‑aware alerts and concise evidence bundles, accelerates decisions, supports custody via rapid alerts and multimodal fusion combining complementary RF/SAR/EO/IR/HSI streams, and reduces operator workload across LEO‑to‑GEO/XGEO/cislunar missions; edge observations continuously update threat catalog entries in the onboard slice (and, when synced, on the ground) to improve future detection and operator tip‑and‑cue.

In Phase I, we prove feasibility through an RF instantiation: integrating a passive RF front end with on‑sensor analytics, and validating performance with payload‑in‑the‑loop simulation and hardware‑in‑the‑loop bench snapshots. We will quantify latency and power/thermal envelopes, calibrate uncertainty, and demonstrate a closed‑loop catalog flow: sensor observations and threat‑detection events update the onboard catalog slice, which syncs to the ground threat/reconnaissance catalog when connectivity permits, and disseminates attack event reports and signal observations to the broader SDA community via UDL—producing downlink‑efficient products and a growing cross‑modal knowledge base. Phase II will implement multimodal sensor fusion at the edge, combining RF with SAR/EO/IR/HSI streams for enhanced threat detection and classification confidence, with a clear, standards‑aware path to expansion without re‑architecture.
