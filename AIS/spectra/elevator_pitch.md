SPECTRA (Sensor Processing at the Edge for Cognitive Threat Reconnaissance and Alert) is a modular, reconfigurable sensor‑compute payload and cross‑modal catalog that brings AI to the edge to detect, triage, and explain space electromagnetic threats in real time—even when links are contested. By standardizing modality‑agnostic interfaces and carrying prioritized “edge slices” of a Space EW Catalog onboard, SPECTRA turns raw sensor streams into uncertainty‑aware alerts and concise evidence bundles, accelerating decisions, preserving custody through maneuvers, and reducing operator workload across LEO‑to‑cislunar missions.

In Phase I, we prove feasibility through an RF instantiation: integrating a passive RF front end with on‑sensor analytics, and validating performance with payload‑in‑the‑loop simulation and hardware‑in‑the‑loop bench snapshots. We will quantify latency and power/thermal envelopes, calibrate uncertainty, and demonstrate downlink‑efficient products—providing a clear, standards‑aware path to Phase II where the same architecture expands to SAR/EO/IR/HSI without re‑architecture.
