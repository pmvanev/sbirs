SPECTRA (Sensor Processing at the Edge for Cognitive Threat Reconnaissance and Alert) is a three-tier, software-defined architecture for contested space operations: **(1) SPECTRA Edge DB** (onboard, SOSA-compliant database maintaining an updatable slice of the ground catalog, receiving updates when possible, providing catalog data to edge compute, and cataloging raw observations and detected events); **(2) SPECTRA HPC-S** (onboard, SOSA-compliant ML/AI/fusion compute performing edge processing of sensor observations, applying AI/ML and data-fusion algorithms to generate threat events and alerts, and providing event detection data to the Edge DB); and **(3) SPECTRA Ground Processing** (ground-based data management receiving events and observations from the spacecraft, disseminating them to mission operations and the broader SDA community via UDL, determining catalog updates based on SDA intelligence, and managing HPC-S model updates and training).

By standardizing modality-agnostic, integration-ready interfaces and carrying prioritized “edge slices” onboard, SPECTRA transforms raw sensor observations into uncertainty-aware threat events and concise evidence bundles, accelerates decisions, supports custody via rapid alerts and multimodal fusion combining complementary RF/SAR/EO/IR/HSI streams, and reduces operator workload across LEO-to-GEO/XGEO/cislunar missions. Edge observations and detected events continuously update threat catalog entries in the onboard slice (and, when synced, on the ground) to improve future detection and operator tip-and-cue.

In Phase I, we focus on feasibility analysis for SPECTRA HPC-S and SPECTRA Edge DB, and CONOPS for SPECTRA Ground Processing, through an RF instantiation: integrating a passive RF front end with on-sensor analytics, and validating performance with payload-in-the-loop simulation and hardware-in-the-loop bench snapshots. We will quantify latency and power/thermal envelopes, calibrate uncertainty, and demonstrate a closed-loop catalog flow: sensor observations and threat-detection events update the onboard catalog slice, which syncs to the ground threat/reconnaissance catalog when connectivity permits, and disseminates attack event reports and signal observations to the broader SDA community via UDL—producing downlink-efficient products and a growing cross-modal knowledge base. A parallel thrust will develop feasibility and CONOPS for a comprehensive test harness for SPECTRA DB and HPC-S validation, including HIL simulation and adversarial signal emitter concepts for live testing. Phase II will implement multimodal sensor fusion at the edge, combining RF with SAR/EO/IR/HSI streams for enhanced threat detection and classification confidence, with a clear, standards-aware path to expansion without re-architecture.
