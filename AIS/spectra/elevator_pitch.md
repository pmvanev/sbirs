SPECTRA (Sensor Processing at the Edge for Cognitive Threat Reconnaissance and Alert) is a software‑defined, reconfigurable sensor‑compute (HPC‑S) payload with multi‑modal fusion and a cross‑modal Space EW Catalog that brings AI to the edge to detect, triage, and explain space electromagnetic threats in real time—even when links are contested. By standardizing modality‑agnostic, integration‑ready interfaces and carrying prioritized “edge slices” onboard, SPECTRA turns raw sensor streams into uncertainty‑aware alerts and concise evidence bundles, accelerates decisions, supports custody via rapid alerts and cross‑modal fusion, and reduces operator workload across LEO‑to‑GEO/XGEO/cislunar missions; edge observations continuously update the onboard catalog slice to improve future detection and tip‑and‑cue.

In Phase I, we prove feasibility through an RF instantiation: integrating a passive RF front end with on‑sensor analytics, and validating performance with payload‑in‑the‑loop simulation and hardware‑in‑the‑loop bench snapshots. We will quantify latency and power/thermal envelopes, calibrate uncertainty, and demonstrate a closed‑loop catalog flow: sensor observations and threat‑detection events update the onboard catalog slice, which syncs to the ground reconnaissance catalog when connectivity permits—producing downlink‑efficient products and a growing cross‑modal knowledge base, with a clear, standards‑aware path to Phase II expansion to SAR/EO/IR/HSI without re‑architecture.
