### Section-by-Section Outline

1) **Front Matter**
   - Volume and Title: "Volume 2: Technical Volume"; Title: "SPECTRA: Sensor Processing at the Edge for Cognitive Threat Reconnaissance and Alert".

2) **1.0 Description of Proposed Phase I Technical Effort**
   - Problem: Current space EW systems suffer from high detection→classification latency, operator workload bottlenecks, and custody gaps in comms-denied conditions; single-modality sensors miss complementary threat signatures; ground-centric processing delays decisions.
   - Scenario: Contested space operations with RF/EW threats, bandwidth constraints, and maneuvering targets across LEO/GEO/XGEO/cislunar; operators need rapid, uncertainty-aware alerts and multimodal fusion to maintain custody and confidence.
   - Proposed Solution (five innovations):
     - Modular Sensor-Compute Payload: reconfigurable, modality-agnostic plugin architecture for RF/SAR/EO/IR/HSI with deterministic latency and SWaP efficiency.
     - Cross-Modal Space Threat Catalog: schema and edge slices for compact, downlink-efficient threat descriptors and observation products across modalities (initial EW focus, expandable to SAR/EO/IR/HSI).
     - Payload-in-the-Loop M&S: sensor-agnostic simulation harness with synthetic threat scenes and red-team attack injectors (Phase I RF, Phase II multimodal).
     - HIL Testing Framework: AWG-stimulated bench validation with latency/power/thermal profiling and uncertainty calibration.
     - Integration-Ready Interfaces: modality-agnostic schemas for edge summaries, operator digests, and future standards alignment (CCSDS/BM-C2).
   - Figures/Tables: Figure 1 (system architecture, end-to-end flow). Table 1 (degree of innovation). Table 2 (topic/AIS requirement alignment).
   - Team: COSMIAC (RF front-end, edge ML, FPGA, radiation expertise) + IA (simulation, catalog, HIL orchestration, autonomy/AI background).

3) **1.01 Technical Approach**
   - Three-tier, integrated, modular architecture: **(1) SPECTRA HPC-S** ingests multimodal sensor observations (RF/SAR/EO/IR/HSI) and threat catalogs, applies AI/ML and data-fusion algorithms to generate threat events and alerts; **(2) SPECTRA Edge DB** maintains an updatable catalog slice, receives observations and events from HPC-S, catalogs them, and syncs to ground when possible; **(3) SPECTRA Ground Processing** receives events/observations, disseminates to mission operations and SDA community via UDL, determines catalog updates, and manages model training. Phase I instantiates RF pathway to establish deterministic latency and SWaP baselines; architecture supports plugin-based expansion to additional modalities in Phase II.

- Provide an early crosswalk table (Topic Alignment) and a focused metrics table. Highlight how Phase I RF work establishes baselines and plugin architecture for Phase II modalities.
