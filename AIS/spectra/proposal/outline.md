### Section-by-Section Outline

1) **Front Matter**
   - Volume and Title: "Volume 2: Technical Volume"; Title: "SPECTRA: Sensor Processing at the Edge for Cognitive Threat Reconnaissance and Alert".

2) **1.0 Description of Proposed Phase I Technical Effort**
   - Problem: Current space EW systems suffer from high detection→classification latency, operator workload bottlenecks, and custody gaps in comms-denied conditions; single-modality sensors miss complementary threat signatures; ground-centric processing delays decisions.
   - Scenario: Contested space operations with RF/EW threats, bandwidth constraints, and maneuvering targets across LEO/GEO/XGEO/cislunar; operators need rapid, uncertainty-aware alerts and multimodal fusion to maintain custody and confidence.
   - Proposed Solution (five innovations):
     - Modular Sensor-Compute Payload: reconfigurable, modality-agnostic plugin architecture for RF/SAR/EO/IR/HSI with deterministic latency and SWaP efficiency.
     - Cross-Modal Space Threat Catalog: schema and edge slices for compact, downlink-efficient threat descriptors and observation products across modalities (initial EW focus, expandable to SAR/EO/IR/HSI).
     - Payload-in-the-Loop M&S: sensor-agnostic simulation harness with synthetic threat scenes and red-team attack injectors (Phase I RF, Phase II multimodal).
     - HIL Testing Framework: AWG-stimulated bench validation with latency/power/thermal profiling and uncertainty calibration.
     - Integration-Ready Interfaces: modality-agnostic schemas for edge summaries, operator digests, and future standards alignment (CCSDS/BM-C2).
   - Figures/Tables: Figure 1 (system architecture, end-to-end flow). Table 1 (degree of innovation). Table 2 (topic/AIS requirement alignment).
   - Team: COSMIAC (RF front-end, edge ML, FPGA, radiation expertise) + IA (simulation, catalog, HIL orchestration, autonomy/AI background).

3) **1.01 Technical Approach**
   - Integrated, modular architecture ingesting multimodal sensor data (RF/SAR/EO/IR/HSI), threat catalogs, and operational context; outputs uncertainty-aware alerts, evidence bundles, and catalog updates. Phase I instantiates RF pathway to establish deterministic latency and SWaP baselines; architecture supports plugin-based expansion to additional modalities in Phase II.
   - Subsections (each with challenge + DoI + methods + evidence/TRL + operational impact):
     1. Modular Sensor-Compute Payload (Phase I RF instantiation; Phase II multimodal-ready) — modality-agnostic plugin interfaces (front-end, feature extractors, model containers) designed for RF/SAR/EO/IR/HSI; Phase I realizes COSMIAC RF front-end (PIGEON heritage) with on-sensor feature extraction (PDW-like vectors) and ML threat detection; compute trades (CPU/GPU/FPGA/SoC/neuromorphic) with emphasis on FPGA/SoC for deterministic latency and power efficiency; security-by-design (memory-safe runtime, zero-trust data handling, signed model/config updates); addresses latency, single-modality blindness, and SWaP/rad/thermal constraints; plugin stubs enable Phase II SAR/EO/IR/HSI integration.
     2. Cross-Modal Space Threat Catalog Schema (initial EW focus, multimodal-ready) — modality-aware parametric/emitter/event descriptors and observation products; Phase I focuses on RF threat models and EW descriptors; compact summaries (detections, PDW-like features, UQ scores, maneuver/change flags) and evidence snippets for downlink; edge slice feasibility (storage footprint, compression ratio, retrieval latency); observation reporting pipeline: edge-detected threats and attack events update onboard slice; when connectivity permits, sync to ground catalog and disseminate attack-event reports and signal observations to broader SDA community via UDL; ground integration via OmniCat (where permissible) or unclassified scaffold with classified pathways; astrometry/POD hooks and tip-and-cue schema (minimal, modality-agnostic) for future cross-sensor tasking and Phase II SAR/EO/IR/HSI integration; addresses downlink efficiency, onboard decision support, multimodal expansion, and SDA community integration.
     3. Payload-in-the-Loop M&S with EW Attack Injectors — sensor-agnostic simulation harness integrated into IA's NGSX scenarios for SDA/RPO; Phase I focuses on RF synthetic scenes via EWIRDB-like parametric threat models and EMoP-like scene generation; red-team EW attack injectors; uncertainty calibration using SIERO-like methods; scenario packs (Theater GPS jamming detection & geolocation, GEO emissions characterization, RPO proximity cueing); harness architecture supports Phase II expansion to SAR/EO/IR/HSI synthetic scene generators; addresses feasibility validation, robustness under adversarial conditions, and custody/latency insights.
     4. HIL Testing Framework — AWG-stimulated bench validation with simulated EW attack scenarios; timing/power/thermal snapshots; signed-config emulation; latency/jitter bounds (read→process→emit); uncertainty calibration curves (ECE/Brier); robustness checks across scenario packs; addresses deterministic latency, SWaP profiling, security readiness, and V&V trace capture.
     5. Integration-Ready Interfaces and Operator Digests — modality-agnostic schemas for edge summaries/evidence, health telemetry, and operator digests; preliminary standards fit (CCSDS/BM-C2) without Phase I compliance commitment; example interface stub (OPIR↔RF cueing with JSON/protobuf fields); addresses Phase II integration, operator trust, and future standards alignment.

4) **1.02 Alignment with Topic Requirements (AIS Subtopic 2)**
   - Table 2 maps AIS requirements (integrated sensor-compute, multimodal fusion, reconfigurability, HPC-S, latency reduction, operator workload, custody, comms-denied resilience, unclassified Phase I, IA/classified readiness, transition/integration readiness) to solution elements.

5) **1.03 Data, Evaluation, & Metrics**
   - Data: synthetic RF scenes (EWIRDB-like parametric threat models via EMoP-like generation), lab/test data where available, simulated EW attack scenarios, bench traces, controlled load sweeps.
   - Metrics: per-component (latency/jitter bounds, power/thermal/SWaP envelopes, uncertainty calibration via ECE/Brier, slice viability, interface conformance) and system-level (end-to-end detection→triage→alert latency, false-alert rates, robustness under stress, geolocation accuracy CEP50/CEP90).
   - Concrete scenario examples:
     - Theater GPS jamming detection & geolocation: measure detection→geolocation alert latency and CEP accuracy across SNR/interferer dwell variations.
     - GEO emissions characterization: detect unusual emissions/behavior changes; measure timeliness and false-alert rates under red-team injectors.
     - RPO (sim-only): emissions-based proximity cueing and keep-out zone enforcement; log relative navigation/decision latency.
