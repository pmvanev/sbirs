## SPECTRA Proposal — Outline and Mapping Summary

### Executive Summary (What this proposal does)
- Proposes SPECTRA (Sensor Processing at the Edge for Cognitive Threat Reconnaissance and Alert), a modular, reconfigurable sensor-compute (HPC-S) payload architecture with on-sensor analytics and a cross-modal Space EW Catalog that delivers catalog-informed edge ML processing for rapid threat detection, triage, and alerting across LEO-to-GEO/XGEO/cislunar missions—even under contested/comms-denied conditions.
- Core subsystems: Modular Sensor-Compute Payload (HPC-S architecture with Phase I RF instantiation), Cross-Modal Space EW Catalog (edge slices + ground integration), Payload-in-the-Loop M&S + HIL Framework (sensor-agnostic harness with EW attack injectors), Multimodal Fusion & Tip-and-Cue Interfaces (modality-agnostic schemas), Security-by-Design Update Pathway (signed models/configs, memory-safe runtime).
- Validates feasibility in Phase I via RF instantiation: payload-in-the-loop simulation with synthetic EW scenes and red-team attack injectors, HIL bench snapshots with AWG-stimulated scenarios, and metrics tied to latency, power/thermal/SWaP, uncertainty calibration, catalog slice viability, and robustness. Targets integration with SDA architecture and UDL dissemination.

### Section-by-Section Outline
1) Front Matter
- Volume and Title: "Volume 2: Technical Volume"; Title: "SPECTRA: Sensor Processing at the Edge for Cognitive Threat Reconnaissance and Alert".

2) 1.0 Description of Proposed Phase I Technical Effort
- Problem: Current space EW reconnaissance suffers from detection→classification latency due to ground-loop dependencies; static sensor architectures lack reconfigurability for evolving threats; comms-degraded/denied conditions leave operators blind; fragmented data across modalities prevents timely custody and tip-and-cue; operator workload overwhelms staff during surge/crisis phases.
- Scenario: Automated SDA Reconnaissance and Rapid Threat Alerting Across LEO/GEO/XGEO/Cislunar Orbits Under Contested Comms.
- Proposed Solution (five innovations):
  - Modular Sensor-Compute Payload (HPC-S): modality-agnostic plugin architecture with Phase I RF instantiation (passive RF front end + on-sensor ML threat detection/triage).
  - Cross-Modal Space EW Catalog: schema and pipeline for edge slices onboard + ground integration; edge observations update catalog entries and sync to ground when connectivity permits; attack-event reports and signal observations disseminated via UDL.
  - Payload-in-the-Loop M&S + HIL Framework: sensor-agnostic simulation/HIL harness with EW attack injectors; Phase I realizes RF case with synthetic scenes and AWG-stimulated bench snapshots.
  - Multimodal Fusion & Tip-and-Cue Interfaces: modality-agnostic schemas for edge summaries/evidence, health telemetry, and operator digests; fusion pathways for future RF/SAR/EO/IR/HSI integration.
  - Security-by-Design Update Pathway: signed model/config updates, memory-safe runtime, zero-trust data handling suitable for ITAR/CUI contexts.
- Figures/Tables: Figure 1 (system architecture: sensor→edge compute→fusion/tip-and-cue→downlink→catalog growth). Table 1 (degree of innovation). Table 2 (AIS Subtopic 2 alignment).
- Team: IA (simulation, catalog, edge AI, NGSX integration) + COSMIAC (RF front-end, FPGA acceleration, radiation testing, smallsat integration); goal is a Phase I feasibility package demonstrating latency/workload improvements and custody gains with clear Phase II pathways.

3) 1.01 Technical Approach
- Integrated, modular architecture ingesting RF (Phase I) and future SAR/EO/IR/HSI streams; modality-agnostic plugin interfaces for front-end/feature extractors/model containers; edge processing within SWaP/radiation/thermal limits; secure boot and signed updates.
- Subsections (each with challenge + DoI):
  1. Modular Sensor-Compute Payload (HPC-S) — Phase I RF instantiation with COSMIAC RF front end (PIGEON heritage) feeding on-sensor feature extraction (PDW-like vectors) and ML threat detection/uncertainty scoring/event triage; compute trades (CPU/GPU/FPGA/SoC/neuromorphic) with early emphasis on FPGA/SoC for deterministic latency and power efficiency; plugin API realized (stubs + example RF plugin); addresses detection→classification latency and comms-degraded resilience (Figure 2: payload-compute packaging and plugin architecture).
  2. Cross-Modal Space EW Catalog — modality-aware parametric/emitter/event descriptors and observation products; edge slice feasibility (prioritized onboard subsets); compact summaries (detections, PDW-like features, UQ scores, maneuver/change flags) and evidence snippets for downlink via UDL; ground integration via OmniCat (where permissible) or unclassified scaffold with classified pathways; addresses fragmented data and operator workload (Figure 3: catalog schema and edge slice flow).
  3. Payload-in-the-Loop M&S + HIL Framework — sensor-agnostic simulation/HIL harness; RF payload model integrated into IA's NGSX scenarios for SDA/RPO; synthetic RF scenes using EWIRDB-like parametric threat models via EMoP-like process; AWG-stimulated HIL with simulated EW attack scenarios; uncertainty-gated decisions using SIERO-like methods; addresses feasibility validation and robustness to adversarial conditions (Figure 4: simulation/HIL architecture and scenario packs).
  4. Multimodal Fusion & Tip-and-Cue Interfaces — modality-agnostic schemas for edge summaries/evidence, health telemetry, and operator digests; fusion interfaces for combining multi-modal feature streams (RF/SAR/EO/IR/HSI) and joint threat detection pipelines; tip-and-cue schema (lightweight cue message: target/time/confidence/spec) for cross-sensor tasking; hooks for future standards alignment (CCSDS/BM-C2); addresses integration readiness and Phase II expansion (Figure 5: interface schemas and fusion pathways).
  5. Security-by-Design Update Pathway — memory-safe runtime pathway, zero-trust data handling, keying and telemetry redaction suitable for ITAR/CUI contexts; signed model/config updates; certifiable update concept appropriate to Phase I feasibility; addresses trust/assurance and transition readiness.

4) 1.02 Alignment with AIS Subtopic 2 Requirements

  - Multimodal Sensor Fusion → Fusion interfaces enable joint RF/SAR/EO/IR/HSI processing at the edge for enhanced threat detection and classification confidence.
  - Reconfigurability → Modality-agnostic plugin architecture supports swappable sensor front-ends and model containers without re-architecture.
  - Edge AI/ML → On-sensor ML threat detection, uncertainty scoring, and event triage reduce detection→classification latency.
  - Catalog-Informed Processing → Cross-Modal Space EW Catalog edge slices enable low-latency decisions and intermittent downlink; edge observations update catalog entries.
  - Comms-Degraded/Denied Resilience → Edge processing and onboard catalog slices preserve mission utility under contested comms; offline fallback and post-recovery re-synchronization.
  - Custody & Tip-and-Cue → Fusion/tip-and-cue design maintains custody through maneuvers across LEO/GEO/XGEO/cislunar; rapid alerts and cross-sensor tasking.
  - Operator Workload Reduction → Onboard triage and operator digests reduce workload; uncertainty-aware alerts improve trust.
  - Security & Transition Readiness → Signed updates, memory-safe runtime, zero-trust data handling; integration-ready interfaces and preliminary standards fit (CCSDS/BM-C2).
  - Unclassified Phase I / Classified Readiness → Phase I uses synthetic, unclassified data; future classified deployment scoped to Phase II with clear pathways.
