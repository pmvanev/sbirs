## SPECTRA Proposal — Outline and Mapping Summary

### Executive Summary (What this proposal does)
- Proposes a reconfigurable, modality-agnostic sensor-compute payload (HPC-S) with edge ML threat detection, multimodal sensor fusion, and a cross-modal Space EW Catalog to accelerate threat detection, triage, and decision-making in contested/comms-denied space operations.
- Core subsystems: Modular Sensor-Compute Payload (Phase I RF instantiation), Cross-Modal Space EW Catalog with edge slices, Payload-in-the-Loop M&S and HIL framework with EW attack injectors, Integration-Ready Interfaces and CONOPS, and Uncertainty-Aware Alert and Evidence Packaging.
- Validates feasibility in Phase I via RF instantiation with simulation, HIL bench snapshots, latency/power/thermal profiling, and uncertainty calibration. Targets integration with SDA community and future multimodal expansion (SAR/EO/IR/HSI).

### Section-by-Section Outline

1) **Front Matter**
   - Volume and Title: "Volume 2: Technical Volume"; Title: "SPECTRA: Sensor Processing at the Edge for Cognitive Threat Reconnaissance and Alert".

2) **1.0 Description of Proposed Phase I Technical Effort**
   - Problem: Current space EW systems suffer from high detection→classification latency, operator workload bottlenecks, and custody gaps in comms-denied conditions; single-modality sensors miss complementary threat signatures; ground-centric processing delays decisions.
   - Scenario: Contested space operations with RF/EW threats, bandwidth constraints, and maneuvering targets across LEO/GEO/XGEO/cislunar; operators need rapid, uncertainty-aware alerts and multimodal fusion to maintain custody and confidence.
   - Proposed Solution (five innovations):
     - Modular Sensor-Compute Payload: reconfigurable, modality-agnostic plugin architecture for RF/SAR/EO/IR/HSI with deterministic latency and SWaP efficiency.
     - Cross-Modal Space EW Catalog: schema and edge slices for compact, downlink-efficient threat descriptors and observation products.
     - Payload-in-the-Loop M&S: sensor-agnostic simulation harness with synthetic EW scenes and red-team attack injectors.
     - HIL Testing Framework: AWG-stimulated bench validation with latency/power/thermal profiling and uncertainty calibration.
     - Integration-Ready Interfaces: modality-agnostic schemas for edge summaries, operator digests, and future standards alignment (CCSDS/BM-C2).
   - Figures/Tables: Figure 1 (system architecture, end-to-end flow). Table 1 (degree of innovation). Table 2 (topic/AIS requirement alignment).
   - Team: COSMIAC (RF front-end, edge ML, FPGA, radiation expertise) + IA (simulation, catalog, HIL orchestration, autonomy/AI background).

3) **1.01 Technical Approach**
   - Integrated, modular architecture ingesting RF/sensor data, threat catalogs, and operational context; outputs uncertainty-aware alerts, evidence bundles, and catalog updates.
   - Subsections (each with challenge + DoI + methods + evidence/TRL + operational impact):
     1. Modular Sensor-Compute Payload (Phase I RF) — plugin interfaces, deterministic latency, SWaP/rad/thermal budgets; addresses latency and single-modality blindness.
     2. Cross-Modal Space EW Catalog Schema — compact descriptors, edge slice feasibility, compression/retrieval; addresses downlink efficiency and onboard decision support.
     3. Payload-in-the-Loop M&S with EW Attack Injectors — synthetic RF scenes, red-team stress, uncertainty calibration; addresses feasibility validation and robustness.
     4. HIL Testing Framework — AWG-stimulated bench, timing/power/thermal snapshots, signed-config emulation; addresses deterministic latency and security readiness.
     5. Integration-Ready Interfaces and Operator Digests — modality-agnostic schemas, preliminary standards fit; addresses Phase II integration and operator trust.

4) **1.02 Alignment with Topic Requirements (AIS Subtopic 2)**
   - Table 2 maps AIS requirements (integrated sensor-compute, multimodal fusion, reconfigurability, HPC-S, latency reduction, operator workload, custody, comms-denied resilience, unclassified Phase I, IA/classified readiness, transition/integration readiness) to solution elements.

5) **1.03 Data, Evaluation, & Metrics**
   - Data: synthetic RF scenes (EWIRDB-like parametric models), lab/test data where available, simulated EW attack scenarios, bench traces.
   - Metrics: per-component (latency/jitter, power/thermal, uncertainty calibration, slice viability, interface conformance) and system-level (end-to-end detection→alert latency, false-alert rates, robustness under stress).
