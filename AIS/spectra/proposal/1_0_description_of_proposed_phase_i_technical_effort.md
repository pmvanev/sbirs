## 1.0 Description of Proposed Phase I Technical Effort

Current space threat detection systems face critical operational limitations in contested environments. Because operators must rely on ground-centric processing loops, detection-to-classification latency remains high, introducing unacceptable delays during time-critical maneuvers and threat responses. In real-world scenarios—GEO neighborhood watch and close approach characterization, missile warning and hypersonic tracking, cislunar SDA, proximity operations safety, RF interference detection and geolocation, and on-orbit change detection—operators need rapid onboard attribution cues and low-latency alerts to reduce kill-chain timelines and maintain custody even under degraded or denied communications. Operator workload bottlenecks persist as fragmented alerts and unstructured observations overwhelm planning teams, particularly during high-tempo operations. In comms-denied or bandwidth-constrained conditions, custody gaps widen as spacecraft lose connectivity to ground support, forcing autonomous decisions with incomplete information. These gaps directly undermine the USSF's ability to maintain rapid, confident threat awareness and response across LEO, GEO, XGEO, and cislunar domains.

Our solution, Figure 1, is grounded in the representative scenario **Contested Space Operations with Autonomous Edge Decision-Making and Multimodal Threat Fusion**, which reflects two critical operational challenges: the threat complexity and decision urgency faced by space operators managing diverse threats in real-time, and the need for trusted autonomous decision-making when communications are degraded or denied. The scenario spans contested space operations with RF/EW emitters, kinetic threats, maneuvering targets, and signature anomalies across LEO/GEO/XGEO/cislunar orbits. Operators face compressed decision timelines, intermittent communications, and maneuvering targets that demand rapid, multimodal threat assessment. A passive RF sensor detects an anomalous emission pattern consistent with a GPS jammer; simultaneously, a SAR observation suggests unusual platform behavior; an EO/IR stream flags a thermal signature change. Ground processing cannot fuse these signals in time. The spacecraft must decide autonomously: Is this a threat? Where is it? What is the confidence level? Can we maintain custody through the next maneuver? Current systems force operators to wait for ground analysis, losing critical decision windows. This context allows us to validate how edge-hosted threat detection, multimodal fusion, autonomous decision-making, and uncertainty-aware alerts can directly improve custody and decision speed, enabling rapid response even when comms are degraded or denied. To address these gaps, we propose SPECTRA, a three-tier, cross-modal architecture for contested space operations, integrating five core innovations:

- **Modular Sensor-Compute Payload (SPECTRA HPC-S):** A processing component consisting of hardware and resident AI/ML/Fusion algorithms that performs onboard multimodal fusion and threat classification with deterministic latency and SWaP efficiency, operating within a modality-agnostic plugin architecture for RF/SAR/EO/IR/HSI; Phase I prototypes and evaluates the RF instantiation via simulation and HIL bench snapshots, demonstrating edge-hosted feature extraction, fusion, and classification pipelines while keeping interfaces modality-agnostic for Phase II expansion.

- **Cross-Modal Space Threat Catalog (SPECTRA Edge DB):** A processing component consisting of onboard database hardware and algorithms that maintains updatable sections of the SPECTRA Ground DB, provides contextual SDA and threat intelligence to SPECTRA HPC-S for informed threat classification, catalogs threat events and observations from edge compute, and produces compact, downlink-efficient threat descriptors and observation products; Phase I focuses on RF/EW threat models and descriptors, with extensible design for SAR/EO/IR/HSI in Phase II.

- **Payload-in-the-Loop M&S with EW Threat Scenario Injection:** A sensor-agnostic simulation harness with synthetic threat scenarios; Phase I realizes the RF case with EW threat scenario injection, enabling custody and latency insights under realistic adversarial conditions.

- **HIL Testing Framework and ModSim CONOPS:** Bench validation with simulated threat scenarios, performance characterization (latency, power, thermal), and robustness assessment; establishes feasibility and test methodology for Phase II prototype maturation.

- **Integration-Ready Interfaces and Operator Digests:** Modality-agnostic schemas for edge summaries, operator digests, and preliminary standards alignment (SOSA, CCSDS/BM-C2); enables Phase II integration and future interoperability without re-architecture.

Together, these capabilities form a cohesive solution to the USSF's core challenge in AIS Focus Area 2 (Sensor Payloads): delivering advanced sensors with integrated processing for space domain awareness and persistent tracking across contested space operations. Grounded in the representative scenario Contested Space Operations with Multimodal Threat Fusion, the system accelerates threat detection, improves operator confidence through uncertainty-aware alerts, and strengthens the operator's ability to maintain custody and respond decisively. Designed for integration with existing space platforms and SDA community dissemination pathways via UDL, the architecture also supports offline edge autonomy and post-recovery catalog synchronization, in line with stated Phase I constraints and goals. Table 1 details the degree of innovation, while Table 2 details alignment with topic requirements.

Our team brings deep technical and domain expertise to this effort. Dr. Vaccaro led AI/ML development for DARPA's ACK/ARAKNID program, advancing real-time data fusion and explainable decision support with adaptive tempo modeling—key to trusted, scalable threat detection. Dr. Swears contributed to DARPA's PerSEAS and PANDA programs, advancing situational awareness, adaptive scenario learning, and predictive analytics from multimodal ISR sources. COSMIAC brings RF front-end design and integration expertise (PIGEON heritage), edge ML threat detection prototyping, radiation test planning, FPGA acceleration, and HIL bench capabilities. Building on this foundation, our Phase I goal is to deliver a proof-of-concept system demonstrating RF instantiation, modality-agnostic plugin architecture, and integration-ready interfaces—directly reducing detection-to-alert latency, improving operator workload, and enabling custody through multimodal fusion. The demonstration will be conducted using synthetic RF threat scenes modeled after realistic space EW scenarios and will be evaluated using Phase I metrics such as detection-to-alert latency, power/thermal envelopes, uncertainty calibration, and robustness to simulated EW attack injectors.
