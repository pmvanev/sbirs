- SPECTRA Edge DB (onboard DB hardware, SOSA compliant)
  - maintains updatable, in flight section of SPECTRA Ground DB, receives section updates when possible and applicable
  - provides catalog data to SPECTRA Edge Compute
  - catalogs Event data from SPECTRA Edge Compute
  - receives and catalogs raw observation data from sensors
  - downlinks events/observations to SPECTRA Ground Processing when possible

- SPECTRA HPC-S (onboard ML/AI/Fusion HPC-S, SOSA Compliant)
  - receives and processes catalog data from SPECTRA Edge Compute
  - receives and processes sensor data 
  - performs AI/ML/data-fusion compute
  - provides threat Event Alerts to host vehicle systems
  - provides threat and other Event detection data to SPECTRA Edge DB
  - downlinks Event analysis to SPECTRA Ground Processing when possible
 
- SPECTRA Ground Processing (on ground SPECTRA data management
  - receives Events and Observations from SPECTRA HPC-S and SPECTRA Edge DB
  - Disseminates Events and Observations to databases like the UDL, and mission operations processing consumers like Welder's Arc in the SDA TAP Lab
  - receives updated SDA intelligence from mission operations processing providers like Welder's Arc 
  - determines proper updates based on SDA intelligence and uplinks them to SPECTRA Edge DB
  - manages SPECTRA HPC-S updates (E.G. model weight and bias updates)
  - handles training for new SPECTRA HPC-S models with comprehensive mission data and HIL mod/sim
