# ORCHESTRA-AI: Operational Rhythm Coordination & Handoff Engine for Strategic Tasking & Real-time Adaptation

## 1.0 Description of Proposed Phase I Technical Effort
Theater-level planning centers face mounting pressure to sustain situational awareness and task coordination across complex, multi-domain environments. As mission tempo shifts from deliberate planning to high-intensity operations, command staff—especially senior reservist watch standers—are often overwhelmed by fragmented data, asynchronous updates, and minimal shift-transition support. This mismatch between information flow and planning capacity degrades decision quality and timing, leading to suboptimal Courses of Action (COAs). Current tools rely on static checklists or operator-driven coordination, lacking adaptability to mission dynamics or cognitive load. Even advanced AI systems often fail to adjust pacing based on stress or tempo, resulting in information fatigue, poor handoffs, and reduced resilience during critical decision windows.
Our solution, Figure 1, is grounded in the representative scenario Strategic Pulse Management Across Operational Planning Centers, which reflects the planning burden and rhythm misalignment faced by rotating watch standers managing cross-domain missions from a fixed shore-based facility. The scenario simulates conditions ranging from routine coordination to high-tempo, surge-phase transitions, in which fragmented updates, compressed timelines, and cognitive overload present the highest risk of planning breakdowns and missed decision points. This context allows us to validate how adaptive update pacing, turnover continuity, and role-specific information filtering can directly improve planning resilience. To address these gaps, we propose an AI-enabled planning rhythm management platform for strategic ops centers across five tempo phases: deliberate, ramp-up, surge, crisis, and cooldown, integrating core innovations:

- **RhythmBridge** (5): Lightweight coordination layer that dynamically manages timing, task progression, and synchronization across planning cycles, maintaining clarity and continuity through evolving tempo conditions.
- **TempoAlign-AI** (4a): An RNN-driven engine [11,15] that modulates sync frequency by risk, workload, and role, using cognitive load-aware streaming and behavior modeling to optimize timing under stress.
- **ContextTriager** (3): A transformer-based triage engine [7,8] that prioritizes ISR, readiness, and operational feeds by mission phase, filtering noise and surfacing high-trust signals at critical planning moments.
- **AdaptiveOps Interface** (6): A role- and tempo-aware GUI that modulates complexity, simplifies turnover, and maintains interface clarity for rotating personnel across all operational phases.
- **RhythmSim-AI** (4b): A simulation engine that models rhythm stress using doctrinal pacing logic and shift fatigue indicators to forecast breakdowns and recommend surge buffers or cadence reversion [5,6].

Together, these capabilities form a cohesive solution to the Navy’s core challenge in N252-097: enabling resilient, scalable, and context-aware rhythm tasking and planning support for theater command environments. Grounded in the representative scenario Strategic Pulse Management Across Operational Planning Centers, the system adapts to mission cadence, improves shift coordination, and strengthens the commander's ability to anticipate, assess, and act. Designed for integration with the USW-DSS UIQ-100 platform, the architecture also supports offline fallback logic and post-recovery re-synchronization, in line with stated Phase I constraints and goals. Table 1 details the degree of innovation, while Table 2 details alignment with topic requirements.
Our team brings deep technical and domain expertise to this effort. Dr. Swears led AI/ML development for DARPA’s PerSEAS and PANDA programs, advancing situational awareness, adaptive scenario learning, and predictive analytics from multimodal ISR sources. Dr. Vaccaro contributed to DARPA’s ACK/ARAKNID program, integrating real-time data fusion and explainable Course-of-Action (CoA) generation with adaptive tempo modeling—key to trusted, scalable decision support. Mr. Mattson adds operational interface expertise, having developed VR/AR-enabled situational awareness and maintenance systems for Navy and Marine Corps platforms, with a focus on operator usability under dynamic conditions. Building on this foundation, our Phase I goal is to deliver a proof-of-concept system demonstrating multi-role integration, rhythm phase detection, and UI-driven decision enablement—directly reducing cognitive burden, improving continuity across shifts, and enabling delivery of higher-quality COAs aligned to operational tempo. The demonstration will be conducted using synthetic datasets modeled after realistic planning center use cases and will be evaluated using Phase I metrics such as update pacing adaptability, cognitive load mitigation, and COA quality and timeliness.
### 1.01 Technical Approach
ORCHESTRA-AI delivers a cohesive, modular solution for theater-level operational planning by integrating rhythm-aware coordination, adaptive tasking, cognitive load modeling, and situational triage. Leveraging real-time data fusion and doctrinally-informed pacing models, it dynamically aligns planning processes to evolving operational tempos. Building on advancements from DARPA’s ACK/ARAKNID, PerSEAS, and PANDA programs, ORCHESTRA-AI ingests ISR feeds, platform readiness reports, maneuver plans, environmental data, and battle rhythm calendars to maintain clarity during complex planning transitions. Its layered architecture, TempoAlign-AI, RhythmBridge, ContextTriager, AdaptiveOps Interface, and RhythmSim-AI, provides commanders with resilient, explainable, and context-aware decision support. Each module addresses a distinct challenge: from cadence modulation and task synchronization to cognitive relief and tempo stress forecasting. Together, they enable planning centers to adapt to surge conditions, preserve continuity, and optimize bandwidth for high-impact decisions.
**Table 1: Core Innovation in Technical Approach (Degree of Innovation, DoI)**

![Figure 2: RhythmBridge dashboard overview with high-priority alerts, cognitive load indicators, and key metric gauges for turnover coordination. The interface provides real-time status of handoff components, AI-assistant chat support, and sync-critical notifications to sustain operational rhythm. (Proof-of-Concept TRL2-3)](figure2_placeholder.png)
Strategic planning centers often lose tasking continuity and event synchronization during tempo transitions, leading to missed briefings or unclear decision responsibilities. Traditional checklist tools remain static, providing fixed task lists or rigid schedules without adapting to evolving operational rhythms, an issue also observed in dynamic execution systems modeled for large partially observable spaces [4]. Recent decision-support research [10] explores cognitive-fit augmentation and dynamic visualization, but primarily focuses on optimizing information presentation rather than adapting temporal coordination itself. Models like multi-agent planning frameworks [16] emphasize distributed tasking but often assume stable rhythms rather than real-time tempo shifts encountered in operational environments.
**DoI:** RhythmBridge addresses this gap by dynamically generating and maintaining a tempo-adaptive checklist backbone that reflects evolving operational phases, task dependencies, and turnover cycles. It fuses planning calendars, ISR triggers, force readiness signals, and doctrinal markers to project upcoming sync points and required decision gates. As tempo shifts, due to crisis events, surges, or collapses, RhythmBridge adjusts checklist timing, reassigns task priorities, and surfaces pending decision deadlines with real-time updates to affected staff, see Figure 2. By integrating dynamic rhythm modeling with task progression tracking, RhythmBridge preserves operational flow, improves turnover continuity, and strengthens planning resilience even during high-stress, multi-domain surge operations.
In dynamic command environments, surging information flows often overwhelm staff’s ability to synthesize, plan, and coordinate effectively. Frequent synchronization points, intended to improve awareness, can paradoxically erode planning bandwidth and lead to reactive decision-making. Today, most systems use static update intervals or simple event triggers without regard for cognitive workload or operational phase. Recent AI-driven decision-support systems [10] incorporate real-time data feeds and adaptive dashboards, but primarily optimize information access rather than regulating user pacing or preserving planning depth, leaving decision teams vulnerable during high-tempo transitions.
**DoI:** TempoAlign-AI directly addresses this gap by modeling operational tempo, staff cognitive load (see Figure 2, TRL2), and planning bandwidth as dynamic, interdependent variables. Existing AI systems such as LLM-based chat summarization models (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini) and adaptive dashboards using rule-based filters or transformer attention mechanisms optimize information retrieval but lack mechanisms for cadence modulation or workload forecasting. Cognitive adaptation techniques like streaming control for LLMs [10,11] and priority-based alerting models (e.g., DeepMind’s AlphaStar event prioritization [12]) adjust flow only at the interface level, without integrating deeper planning phase modeling or doctrinal pacing needs.
     TempoAlign-AI forecasts cognitive strain using operational classifiers and lightweight sequence models (e.g., GRUs, attention-based temporal encoders), continuously assessing when information flow should accelerate, pause, or reframe based on mission phase. Its cadence alignment builds on prior work using Granger-constrained dynamic Bayesian networks [9] to model causal relationships between asynchronous signals, while incorporating recent advances in cognitive load-aware streaming [11] and predictive behavior modeling [15] to optimize pacing. By modulating synchronization frequency, expanding intervals during deliberate planning and tightening them during dynamic execution, TempoAlign-AI sustains deeper analysis under pressure. Real-time cadence adjustments are informed by doctrinal planning patterns, operator interaction signals, and evolving task priorities, preserving decision-making bandwidth while maintaining agility. This enables commanders to anticipate surge conditions proactively, avoid overload, and sustain planning resilience during critical rhythm transitions.

Planning centers must process ISR, readiness, logistics, and alert streams from multiple sources, each with varying urgency, formats, and operational relevance. Today’s filtering approaches are often manual or static rules-based, leading to missed signals, cognitive overload, and late reactions. Commercial solutions commonly use keyword triggers or siloed dashboards, which surface data without dynamically adapting to mission phase or commander priorities [10]. Multi-agent frameworks for data fusion [16] improve distributed sensing but rarely implement mission-tempo-aware triage tied to operational decision points.
**DoI:** ContextTriager advances beyond these methods by applying transformer-based multi-source fusion aligned with doctrinal planning phases and commander intent models. It continuously filters, prioritizes, and elevates mission-critical updates while suppressing redundant or low-relevance noise, dynamically adjusting triage based on tempo, turnover windows, and evolving task priorities, building on recent C2 recommender frameworks that surface critical decision inputs under operational stress [13]. Building on our prior probability graph fusion work [1–3] and Dr. Vaccaro’s hierarchical task network (HTN) planning expertise [5], ContextTriager introduces a layered relevance assessment pipeline that fuses incoming signals, assigns adaptive phase weights across modalities and mission stages, and ensures commanders maintain focus on actionable, phase-critical intelligence throughout operational surges and shifts.

In strategic planning centers, especially those with rotating or minimally trained staff, static, overloaded interfaces cause context loss during high-tempo operations. Current tools often display dashboards regardless of task urgency, user experience, or operational phase. Some systems offer limited customization but lack real-time complexity adaptation to operational conditions [10]. Emerging cognitive load estimation techniques [11] adjust streaming speeds or highlight content priority but fail to restructure decision interfaces or synchronize view complexity with mission tempo, causing persistent context overload during surge conditions.
**DoI:** AdaptiveOps Interface advances beyond these methods by dynamically modulating UI complexity based on user role, task urgency, operational tempo phase, and turnover conditions. It simplifies displayed information during surge operations, expands contextual depth during deliberate planning, and highlights pending actions for turnover preparation. Building on our adaptive scenario learning and open-world model refinement techniques from DARPA SAIL-ON [14] and PANDA [2], AdaptiveOps Interface applies real-time task prioritization, turnover flagging, and tempo-phase monitoring to continuously tailor the decision space to user cognitive bandwidth. This adaptive presentation approach improves situational focus, mitigates cognitive overload, enhances turnover clarity, & strengthens overall planning resilience under dynamic operational stress.
Our TRL 2–3 prototype from internal R&D, see Figure 3, can easily be integrated into our above proof-of-concepts.

![Figure 3: Existing COMMANDER-AI (TRL2-3) Mission dashboard integrating simulated Operation Eagle Shield data with AI-driven text/voice interactions and context-aware prioritization.](figure3_placeholder.png)
As operational tempo accelerates, teams often miss when planning rhythms become unsustainable, causing missed synchronizations, rushed decisions, and breakdowns. Existing rhythm tracking solutions typically respond after failures, focusing on event volume rather than modeling cognitive fatigue or planning strain over time. Some multi-agent planning frameworks [16] and workload estimation models [11] address distributed coordination or user load adaptation but lack predictive modeling of rhythm collapse tied to tempo dynamics.
**DoI:** RhythmSim-AI advances beyond these approaches by simulating operational pacing stress based on doctrinal rhythm patterns, staffing profiles, cognitive fatigue curves, and mission-phase transitions. It applies lightweight multi-agent systems combined with tempo-phase classifiers to forecast when surge conditions cause rhythm degradation, enabling earlier intervention, extending foundational principles from distributed multi-agent coordination and planning systems [16]. Building on prior work in adaptive scenario learning [14] and operational task forecasting [2], RhythmSim-AI recommends proactive mitigations such as cadence reversion, surge staffing, or dynamic task reprioritization. This predictive stress modeling supports commanders in sustaining resilient, synchronized planning even through extended high-tempo operations.

## 3.0 Commercialization/Transition Plan Summary
3.1Commercialization Strategy Overview
The ORCHESTRA-AI platform presents a strong dual-use commercialization opportunity, supporting critical Navy needs for strategic planning rhythm management and operational situational awareness. Our phased deployment strategy focuses first on direct integration into Navy shore-based command environments, with expansion pathways into broader C2 task management, turnover support, and complex coordination solutions for defense and commercial markets.
3.1.1 DoD Transition Pathway
Our primary transition target is the Navy’s shore-based operational planning and coordination environment, with initial alignment to systems such as USW-DSS UIQ-100 and potential extensibility into future multi-domain C2 frameworks. ORCHESTRA-AI is designed to complement the Navy’s shift toward tempo-resilient, decision-centric planning tools by enabling adaptive battle rhythm management across watch rotations, planning phases, and command structures. Our transition strategy is structured to move from TRL 4–5 in Phase I to TRL 7–8 in Phase II/III through tightly scoped validation steps and stakeholder-driven system integration. This includes alignment with Phase III SBIR pathways and potential sole-source transitions via Navy C2 modernization efforts.
**3.1.2 Transition Plan by Phase:**
- **Phase I:** Feasibility validation through simulation and workflow emulation in synthetic shore-based planning scenarios. Evaluation focuses on watch stander turnover, tempo pacing, and task continuity.
- **Phase II:** Development and refinement of a modular, operator-facing prototype. Integration into simulated planning environments aligned with USW-DSS UIQ-100, validated through engagement with command center personnel and planning leads.
- **Phase III:** Operational deployment via SBIR Phase III awards, CRADAs, and collaboration with Navy acquisition or warfare centers for fielding, sustainment, and transition to use.

**3.1.3 Engagement Strategy:** We plan to actively engage with:
- Navy SBIR Transition Program (STP) to refine transition readiness, documentation, & sponsor matching.
- NIWC Pacific (Shore C2 Division) for tech. alignment & potential integration into shore-based systems.
- PEO C4I – PMW-150 (Command and Control Systems) as a potential acquisition sponsor.
- NAVSEA Warfare Centers (e.g., NUWC Newport) for evaluation support and exploration of broader undersea warfare applications.
- Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) as a parallel pathway for rapid testing and iterative field prototyping.
**3.1.4 Commercial Market Expansion**

In parallel with DoD adoption, ORCHESTRA-AI offers clear dual-use potential for commercial sectors that rely on high-tempo coordination, shift-based operations, and continuity during high-stakes transitions. These include strategic operations centers, critical infrastructure hubs, and emergency response networks. Our initial private-sector focus will target organizations with direct operational parallels to Navy battle rhythm tasking:

- **Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs):** Improving turnover continuity and tempo-resilient decision cycles during disaster response operations (e.g., FEMA, state-level EOCs).
- **Maritime and Port Operations:** Supporting complex coordination of vessel traffic, cargo flows, and personnel shifts in large-scale port and maritime logistics environments.
- **Energy Sector Operations:** Enhancing control room task synchronization, grid stability response, and crew shift coordination across multi-node utility systems.
Following successful Phase III transition into Navy units, we will prioritize dual-use entry into emergency management and maritime coordination markets, which share the clearest use case and tempo-management alignment with our government applications. We intend to explore partnerships with commercial C2 software providers, infrastructure management firms, and system integrators that require real-time synchronization, low-cognitive load interfaces, and audit-friendly turnover workflows.
**3.1.5 Competitive Differentiation**

Unlike traditional C2 visualization tools (e.g., Palantir Foundry, IBM C2 Solutions), ORCHESTRA-AI is designed from the ground up for operational rhythm alignment, offering:

- **Dynamic Cadence Regulation:** Adjusts update frequency, real time, to preserve planning depth & decision clarity
- **Integrated Tasking Coordination:** Aligns dynamic checklists & dependencies with op tempo and user roles
- **Turnover Continuity by Design:** Ensures smooth handoffs via built-in sync checkpoints & turnover acknowledgments

**3.1.6 Risk Mitigation Strategy:** Key risks and mitigation strategies include:

- **Information Assurance Compliance:** Early arch. alignment with NIST 800-171, RMF controls, & container security patterns
- **User Adoption Risk:** Focus on low-training, role-aware interfaces with user-centric design & PII validation.
- **Scalability and Modularity:** Modular, containerized architecture enables deployment across cloud, on-premises, or edge.
**3.1.7 Revenue Model and Scaling Strategy**

ORCHESTRA-AI will follow a dual-track monetization strategy:

- **Government (DoD/Navy):** Direct licensing under Phase III SBIR sole-source authority, targeting fleet planning and command centers.

**Commercial:**
- Subscription model for EOCs and operations centers via secure cloud platforms (AWS GovCloud, Azure Government).
- On-premise deployments for classified, utility, or maritime infrastructure clients with specific data sovereignty requirements.
Initial Phase III Navy deployments are projected to target $1.5M–$2M contracts based on comparable C2 modernization budgets. Subsequent commercial deployments are expected to range between $500k–$1.5M depending on customer scale and operational complexity.
