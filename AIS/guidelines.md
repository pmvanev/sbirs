# guidelines

theme: autonomous, resilient, and intelligent space ops

proposal should:
- investigate technical and operational feasibility of concepts capable of supporting coordinated satellite operations (MARL?) across LEO, GEOP, XGEO, and cislunar environments.
- focus on early-stage research activities including:
  - literature reviews, 
  - modeling and simulation, 
  - trade space analyses, 
  - and university or non-profit research collaborations.
- show how it will: 
  - reduce risk, 
  - validate feasibility, 
  - refine mission alignment
- clearly define:
  - scope
  - research methods
  - collaboration plan with research institution
  - expected outcomes
- briefly articulate how the work could inform a Phase II prototype or proof-of-concept demonstration and support longer-term mission relevance.

specific objective examples:
1. Explore novel concepts and architectures that support enhanced autonomy, survivability, and responsiveness in degraded or adversarial space environments.
2. Assess the feasibility of onboard edge intelligence, predictive threat analytics, and autonomous decision-making systems suitable for bandwidth-limited or contested conditions.
3. Analyze modular, scalable systems—including sensor payloads, computing elements, and spacecraft buses—that can adapt to evolving missions and orbital domains.
4. Develop preliminary Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) aligned with future USSF mission needs and evaluate potential integration paths with Space Force operational constructs.


address one or more of the following focus areas:
1. Edge Computing & Algorithms
2. Sensor Payloads
3. Bus Design

# CONOPS guidelines

- clearly communicate how the technology is intended to support a military mission within a defined system.
- facilitate a common understanding of a future system to help develop operational and system-level requirements.
- written at system level first and then expanded on how the technology functions enable successful military operations.
- include:
  - USSF mission and military objectives
  - problem being addressed by the technology in the context of the mission (e.g., existing capability gap)
  - operational overview diagram
  - system architecture diagram
  - integration-ready design for sensors, computing, and maneuver systems

# PHASE I Guidelines
focus on developing feasibility study, which can include:
- technical and operational feasibility of proposed concept within one or more of the focus areas 
  - FPGA, SW/HW codesign, edge compute, neural net fpga updates

Offerors (us) must:
- develop initial CONOPS
- conduct foundational studies to assess the viability, relevance, and potential impact of the proposed technology in future contested space environments.
- clearly describe how effort will:
  - Leverage the capabilities and domain expertise of the affiliated research institution (COSMIAC for HW testing, labs, etc.)
  - Advance the small business’s internal research and development (IR&D) toward a defensible technical approach (further develop POLARIS and RL agent exploitation)
  - Inform a future Phase II prototype or proof-of-concept demonstration effort, including early thoughts on transition, testability, and alignment with Space Force capability development priorities (launch test cube sat to test performance!)

efforts under phase I may include:
- lit reviews and assessments
- mod, sim, or analytical studies to explore performance, scalability, and mission relevance
- preliminary architecture definitions and technology trade space analysis
- operational use case development, mapped to current or projected Space Force mission needs (I think this one is critical)
- identification of technical risks and mitigation strategies


# Phase I deliverables
We should probably mention a plan for meeting these deliverables, and perhaps show snippets that make it appear much of them are already done:

- initial report
- documented feasibility assessment
- initial CONOPS and architectural framework
- proposed Phase II development plan (including scope, goals, and transition relevance)
- final report and slide deck

# other goals
- discuss and/or demonstrate commercialization potential
- mention safety/shielding
- discuss concrete tie in to high priority mission need
- show compelling research potential
