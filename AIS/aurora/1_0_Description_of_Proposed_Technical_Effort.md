1.0 Description of Proposed Phase I Technical Effort
AURORA (Autonomous Updatable Resilient On-orbit Reasoning Architecture) delivers a cohesive, modular solution for autonomous, resilient space operations by moving critical decision-making to the edge and coordinating multi-host assets under contested communications. Today’s constellations rely on ground-loop analysis and operator orchestration; when crosslinks or ground links are degraded or denied, kill-chain latency stretches from minutes to hours, and operators shoulder unsustainable cognitive load. Existing onboard autonomy is narrowly scoped, lacks certifiable update pathways, and rarely accounts for coordination across heterogeneous assets or mission phases (GEO, XGEO, cislunar). This misalignment between operational need and onboard capability slows attribution, risks custody gaps, and inhibits timely, safe action.

Our Phase I concept is grounded in a representative scenario, Cooperative SDA and Tip‑and‑Cue Under Contested Comms, in which a small cluster of U.S. assets must detect, classify, and respond to adversary behaviors across GEO/XGEO/cislunar while enduring intermittent crosslinks, jammed ground links, and strict bandwidth/power budgets. The scenario stresses where failure is most likely—decision latency, custody continuity, and operator workload—allowing us to validate how edge autonomy, multi‑host coordination, and certifiable updates jointly improve mission resilience. Figure 1 depicts our integration-ready architecture spanning edge inference, runtime assurance, multi-agent coordination, and standards‑aligned interfaces.

To address these gaps, AURORA integrates five innovations tailored to AIS Phase I constraints (unclassified, simulation/HIL‑driven), each scoped for feasibility evidence:
- Rad‑Tolerant Edge Autonomy Stack: Quantized/pruned POLARIS RL policy mapped to SoC/FPGA with secure boot/root‑of‑trust and a memory‑safe runtime to achieve low‑latency, low‑power inference under radiation constraints.
- RTA/Simplex Safety Cage & Operator Digest: Runtime assurance that enforces safety invariants and provides traceable logs and human‑oriented digests to support oversight and certifiability.
- Multi‑Host Tip‑and‑Cue (MARL/CTDE): Collaborative tasking and message policies that maintain custody and reduce time‑to‑classification under bandwidth caps, message drop, and jamming.
- Space MLOps & V&V: Certifiable model/weight export with signed, rollback‑safe updates; verification artifacts and logs for on‑orbit update readiness.
- Standards & Interfaces: CCSDS/BM‑C2‑aligned schemas and interface stubs; optional DTN/BPv7‑aware downlink prioritization for prioritized alerts/evidence.

Together, these capabilities form a cohesive response to AIS focus areas with a primary emphasis on Edge Computing & Algorithms and an integration posture for Sensor Payloads and Bus Design. Designed for integration with USSF battle management constructs (BM‑C2) and CCSDS data products, the architecture supports offline/comms‑denied operation with post‑recovery re‑synchronization. Phase I uses synthetic, unclassified data and HIL bench results to demonstrate feasibility, in compliance with STTR constraints and ITAR awareness. Table 1 details the degree of innovation, while Table 2 provides an explicit crosswalk to AIS topic requirements.

Team and feasibility posture. Interactive Aptitude (IA) leads algorithms (POLARIS RL/MARL), safety shields (RTA/Simplex) and Space MLOps/standards; COSMIAC leads rad‑tolerant compute concept, secure boot/root‑of‑trust, and HIL bench execution (power/thermal/SEU) with signed update demo‑in‑the‑loop. Building on IA heritage (multi‑agent RL, explainable decision support, and space M&S) and COSMIAC facilities, our Phase I goal is a proof‑of‑feasibility showing: (i) <10 ms on‑device policy inference on a representative SoC/FPGA dev board, (ii) collaborative tip‑and‑cue improvements over heuristic/CBBA baselines under jamming, and (iii) a standards‑forward update and interface package that de‑risks Phase II integration.
