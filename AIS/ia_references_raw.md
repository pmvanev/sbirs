The system used custom SLAM algorithms to map the area. Artificial feature implementation was utilized where point cloud alignment algorithms failed. Sensor system was developed plug and play so users could attach more sensors and calibrate within a few seconds.
VR Yard Navigation System (TRL 3)
Created a VR game for new hires. The game allowed uncleared personnel to learn to navigate classified areas before obtaining their clearances. This included Lidar scans of the area and a custom character for guiding students.
VR Facility Emulation (TRL 6)
Created a full facility in VR. This included use of microscopes, security operations, nuclear material movement, instrumentation (including radiation sensors), crane operation, and forklift operation. The emulation was free movement and allowed for up to 8 participants on desktop or in VR. 

OPIR
Innovative approaches to data curation/labeling:
At Sandia Labs:
To support incoming data from a brand new class of in flight OPIR sensor, I designed, architected, developed, and deployed into operation a data acquisition system distributed across dozens of components that ingests and validates hundreds of high rate OPIR imagery data streams and aligns them with dozens of time series metadata sources in real time to produce a custom specified data format suitable for internal processing systems and external downstream consumers. We never talked about this in terms of TRL, but looking at the definitions for TRLs I carried this system from TRLs 2 through 9. The system has operationally deployed and supporting real time OPIR missions for over a year now, with a duplicate having just been operationally deployed for a second sensor within the past 3 months.


AI/ML Based Cognitive approaches and systems to improve OPIR operations (better smarter displays of information):
At Sandia Labs:
I proposed and led an internal research project to train and test the YOLO model to do object detection on a novel class of sensor specific phenomenon.
The project worked across TRL levels 1 through 3. 
I developed and/or oversaw development of:
- synthetic training data generation
- a custom training data labeling tool
- filtering and acquisition of real data for training and test
- development of a c++ inference component for real time object detection in image processing pipelines
The internal research project showed promising initial object performance on synthetic test data compared to the existing non-ai based detection method.
Taken to a higher TRL, this project would improve the accuracy of an image registration based "on task" attitude correction algorithm, resulting in an ability to perform longer mission tasks between sensor calibration tasks.


General OPIR Background:
•	10 years experience working on an OPIR sensor data processing ground system in data acquisition, data processing, and geolocation, including 
o	legacy system enhancements and maintenance
o	development and deployment of legacy system major version updates
o	research to inform impact and efficacy of novel algorithmic enhancements
o	development and deployment of next generation systems

SPARC – Sensor Pipeline for Aligned Real-time Curation	End-to-end, distributed data-acquisition pipeline for a new class of in-flight OPIR sensors. SPARC ingests hundreds of high-rate imagery streams and dozens of time-series metadata feeds, performs real-time validation and time alignment, then emits a mission-tailored data product for both internal analytics and external consumers. Deployed across multiple operational sites, it has been sustaining live missions for > 1 year, with a second instance recently fielded for an additional sensor.	TRL 9 (evolved from TRL 2 during architecture prototyping to full operational use)

VORTEX – Visual Object Recognition for Tactical EXploitation	AI/ML research effort applying the YOLO family of detectors to a sensor-specific optical phenomenon. VORTEX delivered: ① a synthetic scene generator, ② a bespoke labeling GUI, ③ curated real-world training & test sets, and ④ a C++ inference module for on-the-fly detection inside image-processing chains. Early results on synthetic evaluation sets significantly outperformed legacy, non-AI detection, laying the groundwork for improved on-task attitude correction and longer autonomous mission windows.	TRL 3 (proof-of-concept validated in a relevant lab setting). Specifically done for OPIR Data
