## AIS Proposal — Outline and Mapping Summary (POLARIS Edge Autonomy + Multi-Agent Coordination + Standards)

### Executive Summary (What this proposal does)
- Demonstrates feasibility of resilient, certifiable edge autonomy for contested space by integrating: (1) POLARIS RL policy inference on radiation‑tolerant SoC/FPGA with secure boot and memory‑safe runtime; (2) multi‑host collaborative tip‑and‑cue (MARL/CTDE) across GEO/XGEO/cislunar; (3) standards‑forward security, update, and interoperability package aligned to CCSDS/BM‑C2.
- Core subsystems/innovations:
  - Rad‑Tolerant Edge Autonomy Stack (quantized POLARIS on SoC/FPGA with secure update + rollback)
  - RTA/Simplex Safety Cage and Operator Digest (safety, explainability, certifiability)
  - Multi‑Host Tip‑and‑Cue (MARL) with comms‑denied resilience
  - Space MLOps & V&V for certifiable on‑orbit model/weight updates
  - Standards & Interfaces: CCSDS/BM‑C2 schemas, DTN/BPv7‑aware downlink prioritization (optional)
- Phase I validation via modeling & simulation (M&S), HIL bench initial results, and metrics tied to decision latency, operator workload, custody gaps, and safety invariants; collaboration with COSMIAC as research institution.
- Transition targets: USSF Space Battle Management (SBM) workflows, SDA pipelines, edge compute payloads; Phase II path to integrated prototype and relevant‑environment demos.

### Section-by-Section Outline
1) Front Matter
- Volume and Title: "Volume 2: Technical Volume"; Title: "POLARIS‑AIS: Resilient Edge Autonomy and Multi‑Agent Coordination on Rad‑Tolerant Compute for SDA".

2) 1.0 Description of Proposed Phase I Technical Effort
- Problem: Ground‑loop latency, comms denial, and cognitive overload limit SDA/SC responsiveness; current systems lack certifiable onboard autonomy, resilient updates, and multi‑asset coordination under bandwidth/energy caps.
- Scenario: Cooperative SDA across GEO/XGEO/cislunar where crosslinks/ground links are intermittent or jammed; assets must detect, classify intent, and take safe action with minimal operator intervention.
- Proposed Solution (five innovations):
  - Rad‑Tolerant Edge Autonomy Stack — POLARIS RL policy compiled to SoC/FPGA with secure boot/root‑of‑trust and memory‑safe runtime.
  - RTA/Simplex Safety Cage & Operator Digest — runtime assurance, traceable logs, and human‑oriented digests for oversight.
  - Multi‑Host Tip‑and‑Cue (MARL/CTDE) — collaborative tasking, message policies, and resilience to message drop/jamming.
  - Space MLOps & V&V — certifiable model/weight export, signed updates, rollback, verification artifacts.
  - Standards & Interfaces — CCSDS/BM‑C2 schemas; interface stubs; optional DTN/BPv7 QoS for prioritized alerts/evidence.
- Figures/Tables: Figure 1 (system architecture). Table 1 (degree of innovation). Table 2 (topic/requirement alignment).
- Team: Interactive Aptitude (IA) with COSMIAC (research institution) partnering; Phase I goal: feasibility evidence and de‑risking of edge autonomy + coordination + standards package.

3) 1.01 Technical Approach
- Integrated, modular architecture: Edge autonomy on rad‑tolerant compute, MARL coordination layer, safety/assurance, and standards‑based interfaces; ingest synthetic and heritage data; produce operator digests and BM‑C2‑aligned outputs.
- Subsections (each with challenge + Degree of Innovation + methods + evidence/TRL + operational impact):
  1. Rad‑Tolerant Edge Autonomy Stack — low‑latency, low‑power inference; secure boot; ECC/TMR; quantized/pruned POLARIS actor mapped to SoC/FPGA; HIL latency/power/thermal evidence.
  2. RTA/Simplex Safety Cage & Operator Digest — safety invariants; fallback <100 ms; explainability traces; certifiability posture.
  3. Multi‑Host Tip‑and‑Cue (MARL/CTDE) — CTDE vs. CBBA baseline; parameter sharing; message‑dropout training; comms budgets; resilience under jamming.
  4. Space MLOps & V&V — signed containerized updates; rollback; SBOM; logs and verification artifacts; on‑orbit certification pathway.
  5. Standards & Interfaces — CCSDS‑aligned data products, BM‑C2 stubs, schemas for actions/evidence/health; optional DTN/BPv7 QoS.

4) 1.02 Alignment with Topic Requirements
- Table 2 maps AIS solicitation/guidelines to solution elements:
  - Edge Computing & Algorithms → Rad‑Tolerant Edge Autonomy Stack; RTA/Safety; Space MLOps.
  - Sensor Payloads (addressed via simulation and integration readiness) → multi‑modal fusion in M&S; interface schemas for payload data.
  - Bus Design (integration posture) → secure boot/root‑of‑trust; thermal/power awareness; HIL envelopes with COSMIAC.
  - Phase I focus → literature reviews, M&S, trade studies, university collaboration (COSMIAC), feasibility, mission alignment.

5) 1.03 Data, Evaluation, & Metrics
- Data: synthetic scenarios for GEO/XGEO/cislunar; adversary behaviors; crosslink/ground jamming; heritage references for validation.
- Metrics and success criteria (Table 3):
  - Decision latency: >50% reduction vs. ground‑loop baseline in sim; <10 ms on‑device inference (SoC/FPGA prototype).
  - Operator workload proxy: ≥25% reduction via autonomous action broker + operator digest.
  - Custody gaps/time‑to‑classification: −25–35% and −30–40% vs. heuristics under bandwidth caps.
  - Safety/certifiability: 0 invariant violations in stress sims; RTA fallback <100 ms; signed update + rollback demonstrated in HIL.
  - Resilience: autonomous hold/safe mode <1 s on integrity breach; recovery <10 s post‑restoration.
