 OVERVIEW

The SpaceWERX Adaptive & Intelligent Space Challenge submission period has been postponed due to the pending Congressional reauthorization of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, which expires September 30. The Department of the Air Force will commence the submission period on the first Wednesday following Congressional reauthorization, with closing dates adjusted accordingly to preserve the complete four-week submission window.

The Futures Series: Adaptive and Intelligent Space (AIS) Challenge is a strategic initiative led by Task Force Futures in partnership with SpaceWERX to shape the future of space control and battle management for the U.S. Space Force (USSF). The Challenge aims to accelerate the development and transition of emerging technologies by focusing on a 5–10 year horizon, bridging the gap between early-stage innovations and future warfighting needs. The Challenge targets key operational needs, including the ability to dynamically reallocate forces, synchronize multi-mission operations, and maintain decision advantage in contested environments. At its core, this challenge also seeks to drive a paradigm shift in how satellites operate and interact, enabling autonomous, resilient, and networked orbital systems.The AIS Challenge demands a redefinition of space operations to address the detection of distant threats up to 35,000 kilometers away and to adapt proactively to emerging orbital regimes, including the cislunar environment. By fostering a forward-looking approach to intelligent space operations, the Challenge ensures that U.S. space assets remain protected, resilient, and effectively managed in the face of evolving adversarial strategies. 

Several key scenarios spurring the need for this technological innovation include the following:

    Proliferated LEO: conventional ground systems and human operators cannot scale to truly proliferated architectures.
    In-space servicing and related Rendezvous, Proximity, and Docking Operations (RPOD): Response time during final approaches to dock, or in potential collision scenarios require onboard decision-making during time-sensitive operations.
    Cislunar and beyond: telemetry delays introduce the need for onboard autonomy and mutually supportive capabilities to allow this function ( i.e. rapid sensor data integration, maneuverable bus, high on-board compute capability)

IMPORTANT AIS DEFINITIONS: Movement and maneuver now carry heightened importance where maneuver involves not just repositioning assets, but anticipating threats and responding with speed and agility.

    Space Domain Awareness (SDA)
    Maps the operational environment to provide warfighters a picture of the threat environment. SDA encompasses detect, characterize, attribute, predict, and target activities to inform decision making.
    Space Control (SC)
    A core function of the USSF is to achieve space superiority. Space control comprises the activities required to contest and control the space domain.
    Space Battle Management (SBM)
    A cohesive set of activities that allow a Commander to control and enhance operational and tactical actions during the execution of dynamic space operations.

OBJECTIVES

    Advance emerging technologies supporting space control and battle management.
    Enable autonomous, coordinated satellite operations in contested orbital environments.
    Align future operational concepts with technology priorities to reduce the risk of strategic surprise.

Based on internal knowledge and market research conducted with industry and academia, the Space Force has identified an initial set of focus areas to bring structure to the crowdsourcing process for this Challenge. Please see below for more detail, including desired capabilities and relevant technologies for each focus area.

Note: 

    The list of capabilities and technologies provided here should not be considered comprehensive. We are open to additions.
    While participants may submit one or more entries for each focus area, identical submissions may not be applied to multiple focus areas.

WHO SHOULD PARTICIPATE 

This is the first STTR Challenge hosted by the SpaceWERX Challenge Program, aimed at accelerating innovation through structured partnerships between small businesses (SBCs) and U.S.-based research institutions (RIs). Under STTR rules, SBCs must perform at least 40% of the R&D work, and RIs must complete a minimum of 30%. The remaining work may be split among additional partners. We encourage early teaming between small businesses and qualified research institutions to meet eligibility and unlock novel capabilities for future space operations.

To participate in this STTR Challenge, companies must partner with a U.S.-based research institution such as a nonprofit university, research lab, or FFRDC. Small businesses can participate by leveraging existing academic relationships, reaching out to university tech transfer offices, or using SBIR/STTR directories to identify eligible partners. Early engagement is key to aligning on roles and meeting submission requirements.

What do you stand to gain? 

    Potential to receive funding for concept development and/or rapid prototyping and prospective further development of your solution
    Potential long-term contract or agreement and continuing business relationships with the USSF and other government agencies
    Chance to inform and shape our nation’s elite warfighting capability, positively impacting our Guardians and creating a more resilient and mission-ready military force
    Opportunity for teaming and technology development
    Potential invitation to attend the Challenge showcase event and network with peers, the USSF, DoD, customers, and other investors
    Official recognition for you and your organization, if selected, through publication on internal and external USSF communication channels

SUBMISSION OF SOLUTION

Participation in this challenge requires a completed submission using the SBIR/STTR website at DOD SBIR. See Topic ID SF25D-T1201. The submission period has been delayed until further notice.
