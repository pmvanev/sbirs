# AIS Solicitation — Main Points (SF25D-T1201)

## Executive Summary
- Topic: Adaptive and Intelligent Space (AIS) — DoD STTR 2025.D, USAF/Space Force; Customer: Task Force Futures + SpaceWERX
- Aim: Research and feasibility for autonomous, resilient, intelligent space operations; develop CONOPS + feasibility for Phase II prototype
- Unique: Phase I ends with AIS Phase I Showcase; showcase materials serve as Phase II proposal (no separate Phase II submission)
- Choose one or more focus areas: Edge Computing & Algorithms; Sensor Payloads; Bus Design

## Problem/Scenario (explicit)
- Current satellites are: dumb (ground-dependent), slow (human-in-the-loop latency), vulnerable, inflexible
- In adversarial, comms-degraded environments, satellites must autonomously detect, decide, and act within minutes/seconds
- Representative use case: adversary satellite approaches US asset in GEO; with AIS tech, detect/fuse/analyze/respond autonomously in <5 minutes

## Focus Areas (innovation modules analogous to ORCHESTRA "subsystems")
### 1) Edge Computing & Algorithms

## CONOPS & Feasibility Study Requirements (explicit)
- CONOPS must include: USSF mission/objectives; capability gap; operational overview diagram; system architecture diagram; integration-ready design across sensors/compute/maneuver

- Bus: modularity; high delta-V; thermal for edge compute; safe autonomous ops; lifecycle extension; tight integration

## Dual-Use Potential (explicit)
- Space industry: autonomous ops for constellations; SSA services; on-orbit servicing; cislunar missions
- Other sectors: autonomous vehicles; critical infrastructure threat detection; maritime; aviation; robotics in harsh environments

## Evaluation & Metrics (analogous to ORCHESTRA)
- Performance targets called out: >50% kill-chain latency reduction; >25% operator workload reduction; custody/persistence improvements; real-time maneuver detection; contested-environment discrimination
- Phase I validation methods: modeling & simulation; analytical studies; trade space analyses; scenario-based performance analysis; risk/mitigation tracking

## Alignment/Crosswalk (analogous to ORCHESTRA mapping)
- Problem/Scenario → defined (autonomy under comms-denied threat)
- Innovation Modules → the three Focus Areas serve as subsystems
- Topic Compliance → explicit requirements for CONOPS, feasibility, offline/autonomy, STTR partnership, ITAR
- Evaluation Plan → modeling/simulation + measurable latency/workload targets
- Objectives & SoW → Phase I activities and deliverables map to feasibility and transition planning
- Transition/Commercialization → Phase II prototype path, Phase III deployment; dual-use markets
- Organizational Capacity → emphasize RI partnership; include personnel/facilities as relevant in proposal

## Logistics & Key Success Factors (explicit)
- Funding estimates: Phase I ~$200K–$300K; Phase II ~$1.1M; Phase III non-SBIR/STTR
- Success factors: strong RI partner; compelling USSF-aligned CONOPS; rigorous feasibility with technical depth; excellent showcase; understanding of space ops; clear Phase II path
- References: include state-of-the-art sources (e.g., RAND, IEEE, NASA, LM whitepapers) as supporting material

## Quick Q&A Note (explicit)
- Page limit clarification: For Phase I proposals, TOC/glossary not required; those are for later phases
