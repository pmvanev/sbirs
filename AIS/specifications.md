 CONTEXT

The AIS Challenge emerges from a broader strategic imperative to align science and technology priorities across services under a unified vision for the space domain. Drawing inspiration from early airpower pioneers like General Billy Mitchell, the Space Force now faces a comparable inflection point: how to apply emerging space technologies to new operational concepts before the domain becomes a battlefield. This effort is critical in the context of an increasingly complex and contested space domain. As global competitors enhance their space capabilities and the risk of orbital conflict grows, maintaining space superiority has become essential to national security. Space is no longer a passive backdrop; it is a dynamic and contested arena requiring proactive investment and preparation.

The future operating environment from 2030 to 2035 is expected to be shaped by increasingly sophisticated counterspace threats, including rapid advances in maneuverability, sensing, and autonomy from adversaries. These capabilities threaten to erode U.S. decision-making speed and operational coherence. The goal is not only to mature emerging technologies but to ensure they are integrated with tactics, training, and command structures that reduce risk of strategic surprise and maintain freedom of action across orbital regimes.

SUBMISSION OF SOLUTION
Participation in this challenge requires a completed submission using the SBIR/STTR website at DOD SBIR. See Topic ID SF25D-T1201. The submission period has been delayed until further notice.
See the STTR eligibility guide and the difference between SBIR and STTR.

Please note that all SBIR/STTR submissions must be completed through the official DoD SBIR portal at www.dodsbirsttr.milâ€”AFWERXChallenge.com does not manage the submission process. For all submission-related questions or technical issues, you must contact the SBIR/STTR site directly. We strongly advise submitting early; many wait until the final hours and encounter system delays or freezes that cannot be resolved after the deadline.
