## Analysis: What You'd Actually Build

### The Core Problem
The Space Force is deploying hundreds of satellites for PWSA (Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture). Some will inevitably fail—propulsion dies, communications lost, can't de-orbit themselves. These become space debris, creating collision risks and cluttering valuable orbits. The government doesn't want to build its own "space tow trucks," so they want to catalyze a **commercial De-Orbit as a Service (DaaS)** market.

But DaaS providers face technical risks that prevent them from offering services. Your job: **reduce those risks through ground testing and prototyping.**

### What You'd Build

You'd develop and validate **enabling technologies for commercial satellite de-orbit services**. This is NOT building a full de-orbit spacecraft—it's maturing specific subsystems and technologies through ground testing to reduce risk for future on-orbit demonstrations.

#### Focus Areas (Choose One or More):

**1. Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) Technologies**
- **Sensors:** LIDAR, cameras, radar for detecting and tracking target satellites
- **Vision-based navigation:** Computer vision algorithms for autonomous approach
- **Autonomous maneuver planning:** Path planning for safe rendezvous
- **Lab-based testing:** Hardware-in-the-loop simulation, robotic testbeds

**2. Universal Capture Mechanisms**
- **Grappling systems:** Robotic arms, nets, harpoons, magnetic capture
- **Multi-bus compatibility:** Works with different satellite designs (PWSA has multiple vendors)
- **Non-invasive design:** Doesn't require special interfaces on target satellite
- **Hardware testbeds:** Robotic systems demonstrating capture on mockups

**3. Collision Avoidance and Trajectory Planning**
- **High-fidelity simulation:** Modeling orbital mechanics, debris environment
- **Autonomous decision logic:** Real-time collision avoidance algorithms
- **Maneuver safety:** Ensuring safe operations near target
- **Fail-safe protocols:** What happens if something goes wrong

**4. Satellite Design Recommendations**
- **Serviceability features:** Passive aids for future PWSA satellites
- **Standardized interfaces:** Grappling points, visual markers
- **Design guidelines:** Making satellites easier to capture and de-orbit

### Concrete Use Case Example

**Scenario:** PWSA satellite loses propulsion, can't de-orbit itself

**Traditional Approach:** Satellite becomes space debris, collision risk for decades

**With DaaS (Your Technology Enables):**
1. **Detection:** Commercial DaaS provider's servicer satellite uses your RPO sensors to detect and track dead satellite from 100km away
2. **Approach:** Your vision-based navigation guides autonomous approach
   - Computer vision identifies satellite orientation
   - Path planning avoids collision with other objects
   - Autonomous maneuvers bring servicer within 10 meters
3. **Capture:** Your universal capture mechanism engages
   - Robotic arm extends
   - Grapples satellite using standardized interface you designed
   - Secure attachment confirmed
4. **De-orbit:** Servicer uses its propulsion to lower orbit
   - Your collision avoidance keeps them safe during descent
   - Controlled re-entry over ocean
5. **Result:** Space debris removed, orbit cleared, collision risk eliminated

### What You're Actually Delivering (Phase II)

- **On-Orbit Servicing** - Technology applies to refueling, repair, upgrade
- **Satellite Life Extension** - Capture and reposition satellites
- **Government Customers** - NASA, other agencies need similar services
- **International Market** - Global demand for space debris mitigation

**Market Size:** Billions of dollars as mega-constellations proliferate
