AIR FORCE SUBMISSION OF FINAL REPORTS  
All Final Reports will be submitted to the awarding DAF organization in accordance with Contract 
instructions. Companies will not submit Final Reports directly to the Defense Technical Information 
Center (DTIC).
PHASE II PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS  
DAF organizations may request Phase II proposals while Phase I technical performance is ongoing or at 
any time after the conclusion of the period of performance. This decision will be based on the awardeeâ€™s 
technical progress, as determined by an DAF Technical Point of Contact review using the Phase II review 
criteria outlined above. 
Phase II is the demonstration of the technology found feasible in Phase I. Only Phase I awardees are 
eligible to submit a Phase II proposal. All Phase I awardees will be sent a notification with the Phase II 
proposal submittal date and detailed Phase II pr
oposal preparation instructions. If the physical or email

addresses or firm points of contact have changed since submission of the Phase I proposal, correct 
information shall be sent to the AF SBIR/STTR One Help Desk. Phase II dollar values, performance 
periods, and proposal content will be specified in the Phase
 II request for proposal.
NOTE: The DAF primarily makes STTR Phase I and II awards as Firm
-Fixed
-Price contracts. However, 
awardees are strongly urged to work toward a Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA)
-approved 
accounting system. If the company intends to continue work with the DoD, an approved accounting 
system will allow for competition in a broader array of acquisition opportunities, including award of 
Cost
-Reimbursement types of contracts. Please address questions to the Phase II CO, if selected for 
award. 
All proposals must be submitted electronically via DSIP 
by the date indicated in the Phase II proposal 
instructions. Note: Only ONE Phase II proposal may be submitted for each Phase I award.
