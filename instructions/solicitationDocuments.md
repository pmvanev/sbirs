Performance Benchmark Requirements  
SBCs
 with multiple SBIR/STTR awards must meet minimum performance requirements to be eligible to 
apply for a new Phase I or Direct
-to-Phase II award.  The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that 
Phase I SBCs with
 multiple prior SBIR/STTR awards are making progress towards commercializing the 
work done under those awards.  The Phase I to Phase II transition r
ate addresses the extent to which an 
awardee progresses a project from Phase I to Phase II.  The commercialization b
enchmark addresses the 
extent to
 which an awardee has moved past Phase II work towards commercialization. 
The SBIR and STTR Extension Act of 2022 (Pub. L. 117-
183) amended the 
benchmarks’
 application
s for
more experienced firms.  Detailed information on benchmark calculations and increased performance 
standards for more experienced firms can be found here
