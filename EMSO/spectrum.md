SPECTRUM (Synchronized Platform for Electronic Combat Threat Recognition and Unified Modeling)
For Proposed Continuation of Interactive Aptitude LLC Contributions to EWAISF Capabilities

INTRODUCTION
The integration of advanced AI-driven solutions for Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (EMSO) testing and orchestration is increasingly crucial for both real-time operational effectiveness and the rigor of T&E (test and evaluation) within the Electromagnetic Warfare Avionics Integration Support Facility (EWAISF). The primary challenges lie in capturing data from diverse threat databases, correlating these data with complex modeling and simulation outcomes, and ensuring that test-derived insights rapidly transition into adaptive countermeasures on the battlefield. Our proposed next phase of the SPECTRUM program addresses these issues by creating robust data pipelines that incorporate existing and emerging sensor and intelligence sources, enhancing AI capabilities to identify and assess threat changes, and enabling immediate reprogramming of EW systems to maintain electromagnetic superiority.

WORK PLAN SUMMARY
First, we will build upon our existing EMoP (EWAISF Model Production) Tool Suite to establish a robust data ingestion and analysis framework that continuously monitors updates from EWIRDB, VOLT reports, and other classified/unclassified sources. This foundation, already proven effective at Robins AFB EWAISF, provides a head start in automating extraction and transformation of complex threat data. By integrating the threat-modeling and data-structuring strategies matured under RAISR (Robust Artificial Intelligence Simulation Registry), we will ensure that these diverse data streams are processed in near-real-time and seamlessly fed to our AI-driven analysis engine for identifying, classifying, and evaluating adversary EMS capabilities.
Next, we will adapt the digital twin methodologies from ASTROEDGE (Autonomous Space Training for Robust Operations and Edge-Driven Growth in Experimentation) and the rapid decision-making heuristics from HERA (Hypothesis Evaluation and Reasoning Assistant) to develop a more advanced orchestration layer for SPECTRUM. This layer will propose and rank operational adjustments—such as reprogramming EW systems or altering waveforms—based on the assessed technical impact of adversary threats on friendly EMS performance. Building on the multi-domain C2 success of ACK (Adaptive Cross-Domain Kill-Webs), we will incorporate a modular approach to orchestrating these EW countermeasures at scale, ensuring that operators can quickly review and implement the most effective solutions.
Lastly, we will unify these capabilities within a demonstration environment at the EWAISF, leveraging lessons from NGSX (Next Generation Simulation Exchange) to handle complex multi-simulator integrations. Through scenario-based testing, we will quantitatively evaluate how well the new SPECTRUM solution adapts to evolving EMS conditions, providing a clear roadmap for operational transition. By consolidating our proven tool suites—EMoP for data handling, RAISR for AI-driven analyses, ASTROEDGE and HERA for intelligent orchestration, ACK for multi-domain synchronization, and NGSX for large-scale simulator integration—we will deliver a mature, scalable platform that meets the next phase of SPECTRUM objectives in achieving electromagnetic superiority.

Since November 2023, Interactive Aptitude LLC engineers have supported Robins AFB EWAISF (Electromagnetic Warfare Avionics Integration Support Facility) in developing comprehensive EW (Electronic Warfare) simulation, test, and integration capabilities. To date, they have successfully implemented automated data extraction processes from EWIRDB, the DOD’s primary database for EW threat parameters. They effectively organized complex EW threat state machine parameters/links into usable formats—a task that other contractors struggled to accomplish for 5+ years, whereas Interactive Aptitude LLC uniquely addressed this critical task within 1.5 years. Using these foundational EW threat models, Interactive Aptitude LLC has also developed simulation, hardware integration, and visualization prototypes to serve additional EWAISF needs. Given these proven capabilities, Interactive Aptitude LLC is uniquely qualified to maintain their EW tools for existing stakeholders, incorporate additional EW data sources into their systems, and deliver additional simulation/test/integration products derived from their realistic EW models, to provide comprehensive EW solutions for the EWAISF.

ACK: Adaptive Cross-Domain Kill-Webs

Contract Number: Subcontract under RTX Contract FA875019C0056
We achieved TRL9 through deployment of the ARAKNID (Anytime Reasoning and Analysis for Kill-Web Negotiation and Instantiation across Domains) system for the DARPA ACK program, supporting the multi-domain C2 vision of ABMS across domains of space, air, ground, maritime, and cyber. We designed a flexible HTN kill-web structure able to perform computation within seconds, while evaluating thousands of different potential CoAs, for automatically pairing the right sensor to the right effector at the right time. Operators-in-the-loop were provided with a varied assortment of ranked options for CoAs. In addition, we streamlined C2 execution by automating the transmission of key commands via machine-to-machine messaging.
