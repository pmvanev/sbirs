# Interactive Aptitude – EW Background and Relevance to AIS Subtopic 2 (Sensor Payloads)

## Executive Summary
Interactive Aptitude (IA) brings deep Electronic Warfare (EW) data engineering, modeling & simulation (M&S), and autonomy experience that directly supports AIS Subtopic 2: Sensor Payloads. Our work operationalizes passive RF/radar threat knowledge (EWIRDB), accelerates reprogramming via verified models, and integrates AI/edge-ready processing to enable reconfigurable, fusion-centric sensing with persistent custody and rapid attribution.

## Relevance to AIS Subtopic 2: Sensor Payloads
Mapping IA capabilities to Subtopic 2 desired outcomes:
- Integrated sensor–compute packages for persistent tracking: TRL5 EMoP tools and SIERO pipelines produce verified EW models and PDWs usable in hardware-in-the-loop and embedded contexts, supporting on-sensor pre-processing and rapid custody updates.
- Novel SDA collection and data fusion: Fusion of EWIRDB + VOLTS + DIADS + live/test data within SIERO/EMSO pipelines; NGSX fuses space/ground sensors for real-time cataloging and RPO scenarios.
- Software-defined/reconfigurable payloads: EW state-machine models (modes/sequences/switches/transition logic) and PDW generation enable software-defined waveform adaptation and payload reconfiguration.
- Improved change detection and maneuvers: CEW/OODA-aligned learning and anomaly detection in SIERO; ASTROEDGE RL tasking demonstrated higher observation frequency with reduced resource usage.
- High-performance compute at sensor (HPC-S): Proven pipelines for edge-compatible pre-processing (PDW, feature extraction) and uncertainty-aware evaluation; architecture patterns portable to rad-tolerant edge compute.

## Background and Accomplishments in EW/EMSO
- EMoP (EWAISF Model Production) Tool Suite – TRL5
  - Automated extraction/structuring of adversary EW emitter data, states, links, and parameters from EWIRDB; export to JSON and conversion to PDWs compatible with arbitrary waveform generators for lab and hardware-in-the-loop testing.
  - Achieved in ~1.5 years what others could not accomplish in 5+ years, unlocking realistic, reusable EW threat models for simulation, test, and integration.
- SIERO (Synchronized Intelligence for EMSO Rapid Orchestration)
  - Advanced AI for EMSO autonomy/wargaming; integrates diverse EMSO data, simulates dynamic adversaries, and supports onboard Cognitive EW mode switching.
  - Trustworthy uncertainty-tracing to compare simulation results/parameters to live/test data, quantifying uncertainties in sensors, comms, and EW—building operator trust in M&S-driven C2 decisions.
- EMSO (Automated Structured Data)
  - LLM/NLP pipelines to transform unstructured EW documents (e.g., test reports, radar specs) into structured formats compatible with EWIRDB—even in classified environments—accelerating the intel→reprogramming pipeline.
- EWSAIF/EWAISF Integration and Demonstrations
  - Built Blue Tech Data and Adversary Data repositories; interfaced with EWIRDB and VOLTS, monitored updates, and implemented AI extraction/evaluation to assess technical and operational impact on friendly systems (e.g., ALQ‑161A).
  - Demonstrated M&S concept architectures integrating DIADS/EWIR and a Model Uncertainty Evaluation Engine to gate C2 decisions and inform reprogramming.
- Cognitive EW Foundations (CEW)
  - Documented architecture and key technologies for intelligent perception, target state recognition, strategy optimization (reinforcement learning), and jamming effect evaluation aligned to OODA loops.

- ACK (Adaptive Cross-Domain Kill-Webs) – TRL9 deployment
  - Seconds-level course-of-action generation at operational scale (ABMS-aligned), machine-to-machine C2 integration—evidence of production-grade autonomy, orchestration, and integration rigor.

  - TRL7 MEBN/PR‑OWL probabilistic reasoning with pruning that reduces overhead by 65% and processing times by 78%—provides explainable fusion/attribution for contested sensing.

## Differentiators for Sensor Payloads
- EWIRDB mastery and reprogramming acceleration: Automated pipelines that shorten time from intel updates to usable sensor/EW configurations and MDF updates.
- Verified, uncertainty-aware M&S: Quantified fidelity/uncertainty tied to live/test data—improves trust in sensor algorithm performance and thresholds.
- Edge-ready data products: PDW and structured feature outputs designed for hardware-in-the-loop and embedded execution paths.
- Classified lab practices and TS-cleared operations at Robins AFB EWAISF—proven ability to deliver in secure environments.

## Illustrative Alignment to AIS Subtopic 2 Phase I (Research/Feasibility)
- Literature and trade study: Passive RF sensor payload architectures with integrated compute; reconfigurable EW/SDA collection; thresholds for change detection and maneuver attribution.
- Modeling & simulation: Demonstrate integrated sensor-compute “payload-in-the-loop” via NGSX + EMoP/SIERO—evaluate persistent custody and fusion under contested RF conditions using uncertainty metrics.
- Preliminary CONOPS: Onboard pre-processing (PDW/features), zero-trust data flows, anomaly/maneuver detection, and tip-and-cue between payloads and bus-level autonomy.
- Risk and mitigation: SWaP/rad-tolerance, thermal management for edge AI, data poisoning resilience, memory-safe implementation patterns, and compression strategies for downlink/mesh networks.

## Summary
Interactive Aptitude’s EW portfolio—EWIRDB-driven data engineering (EMoP), autonomy-ready EMSO simulation and uncertainty quantification (SIERO), structured-data ingestion in classified environments, and space/sensor M&S (NGSX, ASTROEDGE)—provides a direct bridge to AIS Subtopic 2’s goals for integrated, reconfigurable sensor payloads with onboard processing, fusion, persistent custody, and rapid attribution in contested space.
