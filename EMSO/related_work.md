EMoP-Suite and SIERO:
Since November 2023, Interactive Aptitude LLC engineers have supported Robins AFB EWAISF (Electromagnetic Warfare Avionics Integration Support Facility) in developing comprehensive EW (Electronic Warfare) simulation, test, and integration capabilities. To date, they have successfully implemented TRL5 automated data extraction processes from EWIRDB, the DOD’s primary database for EW threat parameters. They effectively organized complex EW threat state machine parameters/links into usable formats—a task that other contractors struggled to accomplish for over five years, whereas Interactive Aptitude LLC uniquely addressed this critical task within 1.5 years. Using these foundational EW threat models, Interactive Aptitude LLC has also developed simulation, hardware integration, and visualization prototypes to serve additional EWAISF needs. Given these proven capabilities, Interactive Aptitude LLC is uniquely qualified to maintain their EW tools for existing stakeholders, incorporate additional EW data sources into their systems, and deliver additional simulation/test/integration products derived from their realistic EW models, to provide comprehensive EW solutions for the EWAISF.

	Develop and institute a capability to utilize the benefits of AI to automate testing capability within the EWAISF by producing an architecture concept that can perform the following tasks: automate EWIRDB emitter state machine and mission data extraction, automate translation of EWIRDB mode, sequences, switches and transition logic map data to emitter engagement simulation artifacts, monitor disparate data sources to identify changes to test and evaluation technical parameters baseline, and estimate the technical impact of these systems/changes on friendly system operational performance. One method of monitoring disparate data sources involves parsing scanned documents to extract relevant information and imagery, which enhances the fidelity of our threat models.
Our team currently operates in an air-gapped lab at Robins AFB, where personnel with TS clearances perform similar work, ensuring that security and compliance requirements are met while conducting highly sensitive operations.
TRL5 - EMoP (EW Model Production) Tool Suite
 	Interfacing EWIRDB (DOD’s primary source of threat EW signals in the domains of air, land, and maritime) with EW software frameworks is challenging, due to difficulty in exporting, verifying, and using the data. We’ve developed our TRL5 EMoP suite to automatically extract adversary EW emitter system data, states, links, and parameters, and provide the data in a JSON format easily accessible to other EW applications. We’ve also automatically converted our EW models into Pulse Description Words (PDWs) compatible with arbitrary-waveform generators, allowing for laboratory experimental testing and hardware-in-the-loop testing for friendly asset reprogramming and experimentation.

EMSO Phase III: expands on the above EMoP Tool Suite with the goal of (1) implementing validated wargaming simulation capabilities to reduce the cost of friendly asset reprogramming, by replacing costly hardware-in-the-loop testing and real-world testing with simulations; (2) using LLMs to load disparate adversary EW documentation and field results into EWIRDB more efficiently, to drastically reduce the timeline of organizing adversary EW findings into DOD workflows, and (3) Identify a path forward for taking developed Cognitive EW policies within simulation, and deploying them onboard friendly multi-domain assets, including decentralized coordination at the edge.
 



EMSO (Automated Structured Data) 

 	The EMSO (Automated Structured Data) project demonstrates the successful use of LLMs and NLP for processing unstructured electronic warfare documents in classified environments, extracting key information and transforming it into structured formats. Hosted at Robins AFB, EMSO processes sensitive data like test reports and radar specs efficiently, converting unstructured content into standardized formats compatible with the DoD's EWIRDB. This significantly speeds up intelligence gathering and analysis, streamlining operations while adhering to classified data handling protocols. EMSO's capabilities directly align with the objectives of ECHO, showing the effectiveness of AI/ML approaches in secure environments.
