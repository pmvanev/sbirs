1.	OBJECTIVES: 
The objective of this SOW is to develop and institute a capability to utilize the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to support Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (EMSO) testing within the Electromagnetic Warfare Avionics Integration Support Facility (EWAISF).  
This effort encompasses a dual-environment framework: a LIVE environment for real-time execution and a virtual environment for adaptive planning. These environments work in concert to enable continuous assessment and rapid response to emerging threats. The framework will support interactive radar system objects across all force types (blue, green allies, red, and gray commercial), accounting for environmental factors between assets and enabling closed-loop operations. 
This effort will produce concept architectures, prototypes, and/or products that can perform the following tasks: 
•	Constantly monitor disparate data sources. 
•	Identify changes to adversary Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) capabilities. 
•	Identify friendly force EMSO systems that can be impacted by these changes. 
•	Identify technical parameters of the friendly force systems affected by threat changes.  
•	Estimate the technical impact of these systems/changes on friendly system performance. 
•	Assess how the technical impact translates into operational performance and effectiveness. 
•	Propose technique options to improve system performance. 
•	Propose measures of performance and measures of effectiveness. 
The strategic goals of this implementation will focus on:
•	Transforming operational concepts and organizational culture
•	Anticipating and planning for responsive and emerging threats
•	Incorporating threat evolution in program requirements and technical planning
•	Ensuring flexibility and resilience in program and test design
•	Maintaining open system architecture principles
•	Enabling real-time dynamic assessment using WEEW Engagement Truth Data

Figure 1: EMSO C2 considering uncertainty-tracking per TEA/live data
As illustrated in Figure 1, the proposed EMSO C2 simulation framework can be used for development/test purposes, with certain components/translation-layers configured for deployable packages. This deployable C2 solution takes input from red/blue/gray EMSO data sources for development/test, including parameters, and test/live data. EW microservices exist to serve as accurate EW models, as well as synthetic data generation. M&S accuracy is then evaluated by the Model Uncertainty Evaluation Engine, where:
1.	High-accuracy simulation results are accepted by the C2 engine for platform-level cognitive EW via a programmed MDF file, as well as enterprise multi-domain C2 systems.
2.	Low-accuracy simulation results indicate in-mission anomalies, where we perform real-time adaptation via an Expert Sub-System for continuing operations; In-mission anomalies are a recorded on the onboard computer for deeper analysis after the aircraft/asset returns.

The architecture includes modular EW models including sensing, comms, EA (Electronic Attack), and EP (Electronic Protect), with parameters derived from EW state machine databases including EWIR.
