## Analysis: What You'd Actually Build

### The Core Problem
Secure messaging apps (Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.) have billions of users who trust them for private communications. While their encryption protocols are solid, the **application code itself** is a massive attack surface that's barely been assessed. Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups are increasingly exploiting vulnerabilities in the apps themselves—not the crypto, but the code that handles network connections, file parsing, notifications, and OS interactions.

### What You'd Build

You'd develop a **comprehensive security assessment framework** for secure messaging applications. This is a software security research and tooling project.

#### Core Deliverables:

1. **Attack Surface Model**
   - Map all entry points: network interfaces, file handlers, notification systems, OS APIs
   - Identify remotely-reachable attack vectors (attacker only needs phone number/username)
   - Characterize threat scenarios specific to SMAs

2. **Security Framework**
   - Identify where security boundaries should exist
   - Recommend protections and mitigations
   - Define security measures for different threat models

3. **Evaluation Tools**
   - Automated tools to assess SMA security
   - Testing methodologies for vulnerability discovery
   - Metrics for measuring security posture

4. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - Tested defensive measures
   - Implementation guidance for SMA developers
   - Risk analysis framework for users and decision-makers

### Concrete Use Case Example
Think about Signal or WhatsApp. An attacker sends a specially crafted message with a malformed image file. The app's image parser has a buffer overflow. The attacker gains code execution on the device—all without the user clicking anything. Your framework would:

1. **Model** this attack vector in the broader attack surface
2. **Identify** where input validation boundaries should exist
3. **Provide tools** to automatically test for similar vulnerabilities
4. **Recommend** specific mitigations (sandboxing, input validation, memory safety)

### Phase Deliverables

#### Phase I (Not Applicable - DP2 Only):
Must demonstrate prior feasibility through:
- Completed feasibility study or basic prototype
- Technical reports on existing work
- Test and measurement data
- Prototype designs/models
- Performance projections
- **Must demonstrate expertise in:** computer science, vulnerability research, and software engineering

#### Phase II (~$1.1M, 24 months):
**Base Period (14 months):**
- Month 1: Kickoff briefing with technical approach and plan
- Month 4: Quarterly progress report
- Month 7: Interim briefing with quantitative capability assessment
- Month 10: Quarterly progress report
- Month 14: Final briefing with:
  - Complete architecture documentation
  - Demonstration of prototype's ability to improve SMA security understanding
  - Documented APIs
  - User manuals and system design documents
  - Commercialization plan

**Option Period (10 months):**
- Month 19: Interim report on matured prototype vs. state-of-the-art
- Month 24: Final demonstration against at least one real-world SMA

#### Phase III (follow-on):
- Transition to commercial product or service
- Funding from private sector or non-SBIR government sources
- Support both military and commercial SMA security

### Key Technical Challenges
- **Comprehensive attack surface modeling** - SMAs are complex with many subsystems
- **Mobile platform diversity** - iOS and Android have different security models
- **Automated vulnerability discovery** - Need scalable testing approaches
- **Real-world validation** - Must work against actual SMAs in use
- **Keeping pace with updates** - SMAs constantly add features (expanding attack surface)
- **Balancing security vs. usability** - Recommendations must be practical

### Dual Use Applications
Massive commercial potential:
- **SMA Developers:** Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage, etc. need these tools
- **Enterprise Security:** Companies using SMAs for business communications
- **Government Agencies:** All levels of government use SMAs
- **Security Researchers:** Academic and commercial security research
- **Regulatory Bodies:** Informing security standards and requirements

## Why This Fits Your Criteria

This is a **strong fit** for:
- ✅ **Cybersecurity** - Core focus on vulnerability research and defense
- ✅ **Software Engineering** - Deep code analysis and security tooling
- ✅ **AI/ML** - Could leverage ML for vulnerability pattern detection
- ✅ **Databases** - Managing vulnerability data and attack patterns
- ⚠️ **Research-Heavy** - Requires deep security expertise and vulnerability research background

**Note:** This is a Direct-to-Phase-II topic, meaning you must already have significant prior work in this area to qualify. You need to demonstrate existing feasibility through prototypes, research, or prior projects.

## Topic Details from Solicitation

### Objective
Secure messaging platforms offer the promise of security, but like all software, have flaws which are increasingly used by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups to gain malicious access to sensitive communications. With billions of users worldwide, secure messaging applications (SMAs) represent a vulnerable, and ubiquitous, part of the software ecosystem. This DARPA topic is seeking novel approaches to defend SMAs by modeling their security risks and recommending defensive measures to protect these critical platforms.

### Description
SMAs are increasingly targeted by malicious attackers, such as APT groups. Not only do they transmit private communications that the user believes to be secure, but SMAs can reduce the security of the mobile device itself: unlike most mobile applications, an attacker only needs a phone number or username to communicate directly with the SMA.

While most SMAs invest heavily in securing their cryptographic protocols, less emphasis is given to the security of the software itself. As these applications grow and introduce new features to entice users, their attack surface expands without the security risks being accurately understood.

This effort would:
- Model the attack surface of SMAs for mobile devices
- Identify where security boundaries, protections, and mitigations could be introduced
- Develop a framework to assess and ensure the efficacy of these security measures
- Provide actionable and tested recommendations for protecting and defending such applications

The resulting tools and techniques will enable SMA developers to better secure their platforms and allow users and decision-makers to perform informed risk analysis of their SMA usage.

### Key Technical Challenges
- Characterizing and modeling the attack surface of SMAs
- Developing a framework that identifies and recommends security boundaries, protections, and mitigations for SMAs
- Developing tools and techniques for evaluating the security features of SMAs

### DP2 Requirements
This is a **Direct to Phase II (DP2) solicitation only**. Phase I proposals will NOT be accepted.

You must provide documentation demonstrating:
- Completed feasibility study or basic prototype system
- Definition and characterization of properties for DoD and civilian use
- Comparisons with alternative state-of-the-art methodologies
- Technical reports, white papers, test data, prototype designs
- **Demonstrated expertise in:** computer science, vulnerability research, and software engineering
