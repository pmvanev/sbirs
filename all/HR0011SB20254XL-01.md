## Analysis: What You'd Actually Build

### The Core Problem
Wildfires are getting worse—more frequent, more intense, more deadly. Firefighting helicopters are critical but dangerous, expensive, and limited by pilot availability. DARPA's ALIAS program has created autonomous helicopter technology (Sikorsky MATRIX system on UH-60 and S-76 helicopters), but it needs **mission-specific autonomy applications** to actually fight fires autonomously.

### What You'd Build

You'd develop **autonomy software plugins** that enable autonomous helicopters to perform wildfire suppression missions. Think of it as "apps for autonomous helicopters" - you're building the mission logic that sits on top of the ALIAS/MATRIX autonomy stack.

#### Your Autonomy Application Would:

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Autonomous fire suppression** - Plan and execute water/retardant drops
- **Intelligent routing** - Wind and terrain-aware flight paths
- **Sensor integration** - Process EO/IR imagery for fire detection
- **Multi-vehicle coordination** - Multiple helicopters working together
- **Dynamic mission adaptation** - Respond to changing fire conditions
- **Autonomous landing/hover** - For personnel recovery or cargo delivery

**Specific Mission Types:**
1. **Water/Retardant Drops** - Autonomous bucket or tank operations
2. **Reconnaissance** - Survey fire perimeter, identify hotspots
3. **Medical Evacuation** - Autonomous personnel recovery
4. **Cargo Sling Loads** - Deliver supplies to forward areas
5. **Crew Shuttles** - Transport firefighters between staging areas

### Concrete Use Case Example
**Scenario:** Wildfire in remote California mountains

**Traditional:** Pilot flies helicopter manually, visually identifies fire line, manually positions for water drop, returns to refill. Dangerous, exhausting, limited hours.

**Your Autonomy App:**
1. Recon helicopter autonomously surveys fire using EO/IR sensors
2. Your app processes imagery, identifies fire perimeter and hotspots
3. Generates optimal drop zones considering wind, terrain, fire behavior
4. Coordinates with suppression helicopter
5. Suppression helicopter autonomously:
   - Flies to water source
   - Fills bucket
   - Navigates terrain-following route to drop zone
   - Executes precision drop at optimal altitude/speed
   - Returns for refill
6. Multiple helicopters coordinate drops for maximum containment
7. If injured firefighter needs evacuation, system dynamically retasks helicopter for autonomous medevac

### Technical Architecture

**You're Building:**
- Autonomy plugin/app using ALIAS/MATRIX SDK
- Integrates with existing MATRIX autonomy stack
- Mission planning algorithms
- Sensor processing (fire detection, obstacle avoidance)
- Multi-vehicle coordination logic
- Decision-making under uncertainty

**You're NOT Building:**
- The helicopter
- The base autonomy system (ALIAS/MATRIX)
- The flight control system
- The sensors (those exist)

**Development Environment:**
- AFSIM (Advanced Framework for Simulation, Integration, and Modeling)
- Generic Helicopter Model for testing
- High-fidelity simulation with terrain, wind, vegetation, fire dynamics
- Eventually test on real S-76 and UH-60 helicopters

### Phase Deliverables

#### Phase I (Not Applicable - DP2 Only):
Must demonstrate:
- Existing technical maturity and feasibility
- Preliminary results, app prototypes, or prior autonomy work
- Ability to integrate with high-fidelity simulation (Generic Helicopter Model)
- Existing modeling and simulation environments
- Clear transition path to Phase II

#### Phase II (~$3-5M, 12 months base + 12 month option):
**Base Period (12 months):**
- Develop functional prototype integrated with ALIAS/MATRIX SDK
- Demonstrate in simulation AND live flight test (S-76 and UH-60)
- Validate through scenario-based evaluation
- Participate in at least one government simulation exercise
- Participate in at least one flight demonstration event

**Example Capstone Scenarios:**
- Single Aircraft: Fixed burn fire suppression with automated drop planning
- Single Aircraft: Rooftop personnel recovery with autonomous landing/hoist
- Multi-Aircraft: Coordinated wildfire suppression (recon + suppression)
- Single Aircraft: Cargo sling load delivery
- Single Aircraft: Reconnaissance with EO/IR sensors
- Single Aircraft: Crew shuttle with dynamic routing

**Option Period (12 months):**
- Multi-aircraft scenario development
- Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) development
- Airspace integration for mixed civil/military operations
- ISR-driven multi-aircraft coordination
- Tactical autonomy for contested environments
- Cross-domain mission profiles (simultaneous fire suppression + SAR)

#### Phase III (follow-on):
- Commercial wildfire response services
- Military autonomous surveillance and reconnaissance
- Broader emergency services applications
- AI app development ecosystem

### Key Technical Challenges
- **Fire behavior modeling** - Predicting fire spread and optimal suppression points
- **Sensor fusion** - Integrating EO/IR, weather, terrain data
- **Multi-vehicle coordination** - Deconfliction and collaborative planning
- **Dynamic replanning** - Adapting to rapidly changing conditions
- **Safety assurance** - Autonomous operations in complex environments
- **Integration with ALIAS/MATRIX** - Working within existing autonomy framework
- **Real-world validation** - Transitioning from simulation to live flight

### Dual Use Applications
Massive commercial and military potential:
- **Commercial Wildfire Response** - Private firefighting services
- **Emergency Services** - Medical evacuation, disaster response
- **Military Applications** - Autonomous logistics, reconnaissance, resupply
- **Search and Rescue** - Autonomous SAR operations
- **Agricultural** - Precision agriculture applications
- **Infrastructure Inspection** - Autonomous inspection missions

## Why This Fits Your Criteria

This is an **EXCELLENT fit** for:
- ✅ **AI/Autonomy** - Core autonomous decision-making and planning
- ✅ **Reinforcement Learning** - Optimal mission planning and adaptation
- ✅ **Sensor Fusion** - Integrating multiple data sources
- ✅ **Software Engineering** - Complex software system development
- ✅ **Modeling & Simulation** - AFSIM integration and testing
- ✅ **Real-world Impact** - Saving lives and property from wildfires
- ⚠️ **Aviation Domain** - Requires understanding of helicopter operations
- ⚠️ **Large Scale** - SBIR XL means bigger project, more funding, more complexity

**Note:** This is SBIR XL (extra large), meaning larger scope and funding than typical SBIR. Direct-to-Phase-II only, so you need demonstrated prior autonomy work.
