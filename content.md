OBJECTIVE

A tactical tool or capability to increase situational awareness and enhance decision support of Warfighters operating in Chemical and Biological (CB) contested environments. The innovative technology proposed should work within Human Machine Interface (HMI) concepts to provide significant advantage compared to its size, weight, and power (SWAP) demands. This may include tactical augmented reality, sensor visualization solutions, or unique end user device/materials solutions.

ITAR

The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.

DESCRIPTION

Joint Warfighters are increasingly required to rapidly process volumes of complex information from diverse sources to maintain operational effectiveness in dynamic environments. Operating in CB contested environments imposes additional challenges such as restrictive personal protective equipment, specialized equipment requirements, and high risk/time sensitive nature of the mission. The CBD SBIR Program is seeking an innovative capability to increase the efficient integration, visualization, and communication of tactical data to increase situational awareness and enhance decision-making on the battlefield. The proposed solution may be in the form of a novel tactical end user device or an enhancement to current kit.

For example, Heads Up Displays (HUD) in the tactical environment intend to deliver Warfighters critical information directly to their field of view, with the intent to keep ‘heads up and on the fight’. However, implementing HUDs tactically also present challenges such as decreased field of view, motion sickness, eye strain, and cognitive overload. Implementing HUDs while wearing a M50 respirator quickly also exacerbates the physical strain and minimizes the HUDs effectiveness.

Other technologies that have seen success in the public sector include holographic diffractive waveform technology utilizing ingrained diffractive gratings within a lens for image visualization. General non-holographic diffractive waveguide technology has seen success as well, though with lower image and color quality. The integration of these technologies, potentially of waveguide into polycarbonate, and in general to CB kit and mission space is of interest.

The proposed solution may be head borne, wrist worn, handheld, or other, but must be specific to enhancing the CB mission. Picture two Soldiers executing a Sensitive Site Exploitation in MOPP and carrying more CB sensors than they can hold in their hands between them. The goal is to create a solution so that each of the Soldiers as well as command post receive the same sensor data in real time to make a rapid and informed tactical decision.

The proposed solution must be adaptable to various CB applications and use with Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) kits. Any head borne solutions must integrate with a variety of respirators, to include the M50, and must adhere to battlefield eyewear safety guidelines. Additional hardware considerations include physical connections, network stack and operating system, data transmission, and any non-standard characteristics.

Additionally, any software must be built to Integrated Sensor Architecture (ISA) standards and comply with the current version of the Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) Software Development Kit (SDK). Additional software considerations include the hardware requirements for the software, installation and configuration, user interface and experience, and network connections. Software development should also be advised by DISA Application Security and Development STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guide): https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/stigs/zip/U_ASD_V6R3_STIG.zip.

PHASE I

Phase I requires delivery of a proof of concept for the technology solution proposed. The technology should increase tactical data sharing and visualization in near real time to support battlefield situational awareness and decision support in CB contested environments.

The initial prototype deliverable should communicate functional, physical, environmental, and software considerations, as appropriate, for the full spectrum of CB operational use. The functional considerations required for delivery at the end of Phase I include design specifications, performance specifications, operational modes, input/output requirements, control and monitoring mechanisms, display, security considerations, information transmission methods and framework, etc. Should the proposal include hardware, physical elements to be detailed at delivery of Phase I include SWAP requirements, form factor, materials, finish, hardening, mounting, and interface specifications. Environmental elements required in Phase I include minimum and maximum storage and usage, temperature ranges, altitude, vibration and shock. Should the proposal include software, the elements required in Phase I include user interface specifications, proposed APIs, code development approach, configuration management, and security considerations. A proposed concept of operation for testing and integration with existing DOD systems, as well as a Phase II/future development plan should also be delivered.

PHASE II

Phase II requires delivery of a hardware and/or software pre-production prototype for the technology solution proposed. By the end of Phase II, the core features and performance of the solution should be developed and working as designed. Performance including speed, accuracy, throughput, and response time should achieve target specifications. The prototype will be tested against the Phase I considerations and in line with DOD CB CONOPs. The prototype should be available to test in light movement at integration events to ensure durability, user acceptance, and identify areas of development.

PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS

PHASE III: Phase III will focus on hardware/software performance testing of the prototype to validate its effectiveness in operational use cases. It will also include testing for user acceptance, ruggedization, verification and validation, and larger operational integration. Phase III would require the delivery of user manuals, support to demonstrations, and Transition Agreement support.

PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The technology developed to meet this topic has the potential to have strong linkages with public industry and civilian use cases. For example, real time data visualization could be applied to commercial pilots receiving information from control towers, emergency personnel such as firefighters and police visualizing a building layout, route, suspect information, or oxygen/carbon monoxide sensor data, or in manufacturing with projections of instructions and diagrams for efficient assembly while keeping hands free. This technology could likely be applied to a variety of positions or functions in which real time data and information needs to be received, managed, and visualized across multiple users to make critical decisions while keeping hands on task.

OBJECTIVE

Secure messaging platforms offer the promise of security, but like all software, have flaws which are increasingly used by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups to gain malicious access to sensitive communications. With billions of users worldwide, secure messaging applications (SMAs) represent a vulnerable, and ubiquitous, part of the software ecosystem. For most, the decision to transition from the unencrypted communication platforms to SMAs offers a sense of security. However, while the cryptographic protocols used by SMAs have well-understood and well-tested security properties, little has been done to systematically assess the security risks of the applications themselves: the code that interacts with the network and the mobile operating system. This represents an enormous attack surface, remotely reachable by an attacker. APT groups have recognized the malicious potential of such platforms, and the demand for capabilities that exploit SMAs has been steadily rising. This Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) topic is seeking novel approaches to defend SMAs by modeling their security risks and recommending defensive measures to protect these critical platforms.

DESCRIPTION

SMAs are a class of applications running on mobile devices which are increasingly targeted by malicious attackers, such as APT groups. Not only do they transmit private communications that the user believes to be secure, but SMAs can reduce the security of the mobile device itself: unlike most mobile applications, an attacker only needs a phone number or username to communicate directly with the SMA. The SMAs in wide use today all share similar cryptographic protocols, software architectures and feature sets. In order to best understand the risks and weaknesses inherent to such applications, this effort will develop models, frameworks, and methods of evaluation to defend SMAs from real-world attack. While most SMAs invest heavily in securing their cryptographic protocols, less emphasis is given to the security of the software itself. As these applications grow and introduce new features to entice users, their attack surface expands without the security risks being accurately understood. This effort would model the attack surface of SMAs for mobile devices and identify where security boundaries, protections, and mitigations could be introduced. This effort would then develop a framework to assess and ensure the efficacy of these security measures. The results of this effort will provide actionable and tested recommendations for protecting and defending such applications. The resulting tools and techniques will not only enable SMA developers to better secure their platforms, it will allow users and decision-makers to perform informed risk analysis of their SMA usage, better equipping them to accurately understand the security of their data as encrypted communication becomes embedded in daily life. The program seeks novel approaches to key technical challenges, including but not limited to:

    Characterizing and modeling the attack surface of SMAs.
    Developing a framework that identifies and recommends security boundaries, protections, and mitigations for SMAs.
    Developing tools and techniques for evaluating the security features of SMAs.

PHASE I

This is a Direct to Phase II (DP2) solicitation. Therefore, Phase I proposals will not be accepted or reviewed. Phase I feasibility will be demonstrated through evidence of: a completed feasibility study or a basic prototype system; definition and characterization of properties desirable for both Department of Defense (DoD) and civilian use; and comparisons with alternative state-of-the-art methodologies (competing approaches). This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have application to the core objective of creating a framework to assess the security of SMAs. Proposers interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility described above have been met and describe the potential military or commercial applications. DP2 feasibility documentation should include:

    technical reports describing results and conclusions of existing work, particularly regarding the commercial opportunity or DoD insertion opportunity, and risks/mitigations, assessments;
    presentation materials and/or white papers;
    technical papers
    test and measurement data;
    prototype designs/models;
    performance projections, goals, or results in different use cases 

This collection of material will verify mastery of the required content for DP2 consideration. DP2 proposers must also demonstrate knowledge, skills, and ability in computer science, vulnerability research, and software engineering. For detailed information on DP2 requirements and eligibility, please refer to the DoD BAA and the DARPA Instructions for this topic.

PHASE II

The goal of this topic is to design and develop prototype models, frameworks, and methods of evaluation to defend SMAs from real-world attacks.

DP2 proposals should:

    describe a proposal to achieve the aforementioned goals;
    present a technical plan and approach, with notable risks/mitigations; and
    detail proposed metrics and scope for final evaluation. 

Phase II will culminate in a demonstration that shows compelling use cases consistent with commercial opportunities and/or insertion into a DARPA program which seeks to establish automated vulnerability discovery capabilities for cybersecurity applications.

The below schedule of milestones and deliverables is provided to establish expectations and desired results/end products for the Phase II period effort.

Schedule/Milestones/Deliverables: Proposers will execute Research and Development (R&D) plan as described in their proposal including the following:

    Month 1: Phase I Kickoff briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA Program Manager (PM) including: any updates to the proposed plan and technical approach, risks/mitigations, schedule (inclusive of dependencies) with planned capability milestones and deliverables, proposed metrics, and plan for prototype demonstration/validation.
    Month 4: Quarterly technical progress report detailing technical progress to date, tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (while this would normally report progress against the plan detailed in the proposal or presented at the Kickoff briefing, it is understood that scientific discoveries, competition, and regulatory changes may all have impacts on the planned work and DARPA must be made aware of any revisions that result), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.
    Month 7: Interim technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM detailing progress made (including quantitative assessment of capabilities developed to date), tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, planned activities, technical plan for the second half of Phase II the demonstration/verification plan for the end of Phase II, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.
    Month 10: Quarterly technical progress report detailing technical progress made, tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (with necessary updates as in the parenthetical remark for Months 4 and 7), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.
    Month 14: Final technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM. Final architecture with documented details; a demonstration of prototype’s ability to improve an understanding of SMA security against real-world attacks; documented APIs; and any other necessary documentation (including, at a minimum, user manuals and a detailed system design document; and the commercialization plan).
    Month 19 (Phase II Option period): Interim report of matured prototype performance against existing state-of-the-art technologies, documenting key technical gaps towards productization.
    Month 24 (Phase II Option period): Final Phase II Option period technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM including prototype performance against existing state-of-the-art technologies, including demonstration of the prototype applicability against at least one real-world SMA.

PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS

Phase III work will be oriented towards transition and commercialization of this topic. The proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-SBIR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype software into a viable product or non-R&D service for sale in military or private sector markets. Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR Program. A vulnerability framework for attacks representing the entire attack surface of a secure messaging application will support national efforts in both commercial and military applications for better securing communications. Users of the framework and the results of the security assessment will be able to mitigate risks and develop proper communication protocols for their staff to ensure security and privacy.

OBJECTIVE

The DoD seeks to develop unguided behavioral discovery technologies to accelerate detection and medical countermeasure development against current and future threats. These platforms will enable:

    Quantification of novel behaviors in pre-clinical animal models that are more sensitive than state-of-the-art.
    High-throughput evaluation of intervention efficacy in animal models with high translational value.

DESCRIPTION

It is impossible to ethically conduct human studies on emerging CBRN threats for the development of effective medical countermeasures (MCM); therefore, the DoD relies on pre-clinical animal models for these efforts [1]. However, animal model behavioral evaluations remain un-modernized, insensitive, and prone to significant variability between operators and protocols. Furthermore, the threat agent doses required to elicit an observable symptomatic response in animal models are much higher than doses that are effective threats to the warfighter. These limitations in reliability and sensitivity hinder rapid emerging threat detection and MCM development. It is therefore paramount to develop more sensitive and unbiased platforms for the discovery and quantification of animal behavior more quickly and at lower levels of effect.

 

Recent innovations in machine learning have enabled sensitive detection of animal behaviors in indications including pain response, psychiatric conditions and social interactions [2,3,4]. Novel movement patterns and relationships between physical features and movements of animals that are indicative of a response to stimuli can now be quantitatively captured beyond what historical “gold standard” assays can accomplish. The development of technologies that can capture these nuanced novel behaviors and that are agnostic to the stimuli in interest are therefore highly desirable [5]. The end goal of this effort is to provide automated and high-throughput behavioral profiling technologies to accelerate the discovery of both therapeutics and countermeasures that can serve to protect the warfighter.

 

The evaluation of chemical and biological threat agents poses additional challenges in the sphere of animal behavior:

    The behavioral feature space sampled must be sufficiently broad to capture unknown phenotypes with unknown kinetics following exposure.
    The desired speed of response to a given threat agent necessitates high-throughput processing and rapid identification/ detection of features.
    Use of lethality as an endpoint poses ethical considerations.
    Platforms must overcome restricted handling and be compatible with high levels of containment. The DoD therefore seeks scalable solutions for the evaluation of toxic endpoints at sublethal doses across animal models spanning insects to mammalian species.

Ultimately, an unbiased behavioral detection system is desired for sensitive evaluation of animal behaviors to support both defense health capabilities as well as chemical and biological defense initiatives throughout the DoD.

 

Physiologies of interest include but are not limited to:

    Toxidromes
    Neuropsychiatric disorders
    Seizure characterization
    Traumatic brain injury
    Neurodegenerative disorders
    Sleep State

The proposed final solution should:

    Use non-invasive measurements. Surgery is disallowed.
    Not require human annotation of behaviors.
    Identify behavioral responses not previously quantified through human observation for assessing the indication area(s) or interest.
    Demonstrate that incorporating novel behavior detection outperforms relevant state-of-the-art behavioral assays in accurately identifying indication area(s) of interest. State-of-the-art behavioral assays vary by field and should be appropriately included by the proposer.
    Demonstrate increased sensitivity towards identifying exposed animal to subclinical drug dose or identifying acutely diseased animal in a presymptomatic disease state. (Diseases with acute (<2 week) progressions are of interest. Genetic models of disease are not allowed.)
    Integrate multiple behavioral feature spaces: (e.g. movement tracking, orofacial recognition, auditory cues).
    Minimize animal handling and training by the operator.

PHASE I

(8 months) The objective of Phase I is to develop a prototype instrument for the automated detection of novel behaviors in one or more animal model (s). To this end, performers should demonstrate that this prototype meets or exceeds the sensitivity and specificity of state-of-the-art behavioral assays for their physiology of interest. Further, phase I efforts should demonstrate reproducibility of results on both the same animal cohort and independent cohorts to account for habituation to assay environment and ensure low variability between studies. When considering endpoints that can result from multiple different perturbations (e.g. pain: heat, mechanical, neurological, etc.) demonstrate performance when implemented across multiple stimuli. Success in this phase will also demonstrate dose-sensitivity of the given detection modality (technical justification should be provided for binary classification regimes).

 

Phase I fixed payable milestones for this program should include:

    Month 1: Report on initial architectures, algorithms, and learning approaches.
    Month 3: Report on acquisition of initial training and test data sets (experimental, simulated or modeled), proposed evaluation metrics, and initial analyses and results.
    Month 5: Interim report describing performance of prototype system.
    Month 8: Demonstrate a prototype capable of automated detection of novel behaviors in one animal model. The demonstration will use naïve animals exposed to performer-selected perturbations of interest.
    Final Phase I Report summarizing approach; prototype architectures and algorithms; data sets; results; comparison with alternative state-of-the-art methodology; quantification of accuracy; quantification of robustness to errors, noise, dropouts, distortions; and quantification of generalizability (ability to model and predict behaviors not explicitly trained on). Report will include drafted instructions/manual for prototype users.

For performers looking to progress into Phase II, this report will additionally describe the technical feasibility of adapting the prototype in five directions of compatibility:

    Detecting other physiologies of interest;
    Use in an aerosolized toxic environment;
    Use in high-throughput settings;
    Generation of behavioral barcodes that aren’t reliant on singular behavioral features, and;
    Use in another animal model.

The report should describe if there will be significant costs associated with any of the compatibility directions. The projected technical readiness level (TRL) shall achieve a TRL of 3 and provide a clear path to Phase II/III and follow-on commercialization.

 

Direct to Phase II (DP2): Feasibility Criteria:

 

Proposers may apply directly to Phase II if Phase I feasibility has been met outside of the SBIR program. To this end, proposers should provide technical documentation demonstrating automated detection of novel animal behavior for one or more unique physiologies (e.g. pain response, social interaction, neuropsychiatric disorders). Sensitivity and specificity of detected features should match or surpass 1 or more state-of-the-art behavioral assays for a given field. Documentation to substantiate scientific and technical merit/ feasibility may include peer-reviewed journal publications, pre-prints, patents, and/ or proprietary reports. For non-peer reviewed evidence, please provide technical descriptions for experimental design, instrument use, implementation, and requirements such that the data package can be reviewed effectively. Further, DP2 proposers should also include a report including the same information required in a Phase 1 final report:

 

In this report, provide descriptions of the following: summarized approach, prototype architectures and algorithms, data sets, results, comparison with alternative state-of-the-art methodology, quantification of accuracy, quantification of robustness to errors, noise, dropouts, distortions; and quantification of generalizability (ability to model and predict behaviors not explicitly trained on).

 

This report will additionally describe the technical feasibility of adapting the prototype in five directions of compatibility:

    Detecting other physiologies of interest;
    Use in an aerosolized toxic environment;
    Use in high-throughput settings;
    Generation of behavioral barcodes that aren’t reliant on singular behavioral features, and;
    Use in another animal model.

PHASE II

(24 months) Advance and refine technology developed during Phase I with an optimized design that addresses two or more of the five areas of compatibility outlined in the Phase I report. Fabricate and demonstrate an advanced prototype for laboratory application, verifying that novel behaviors detected by the prototype outperform state of the art for the given indication, animal model, environment, or scale. The 12-month and 24-month demonstration should use naïve animals exposed to a DARPA-selected drug or pathogen which will be chosen based on the performer-selected indications of interest. Provide a report, associated drawings, and control software/source code, if applicable, documenting the theoretical process, design, including any sub-system specifications, performance characterization, projected reliability/maintainability/cost and recommendations to implement the design and implement the system in the target military or commercial application. Deliver a full-scale prototype to support technical testing and evaluation for application in chemical and biodefense response by the end of Phase II. The projected technical readiness level shall be at TRL 6 at the end of Phase II.

 

Phase II fixed milestones for this program should include:

    Month 2: Report on lessons learned, updated architectures, algorithms, and learning approaches. Report will include summaries of existing training datasets and anticipated additional datasets, quantification of accuracy; and quantification of generalizability (ability to model and predict behaviors not explicitly trained on).
    Month 4: Report on Phase II proposed evaluation metrics, initial analyses and results to include quantitative progress towards addressing at least 1 area of compatibility.
    Month 6: Interim report describing performance of system in 1 area of compatibility.
    Month 9: Demonstrate a prototype capable of automated detection of novel behaviors in 1 area of compatibility. The demonstration will use naïve animals exposed to performer-selected indications of interest. Interim report quantifying system performance, comparing with alternative state-of-the art approaches using machine learning or other conventional methods, and documenting lessons learned.
    Month 12: Demonstrate a prototype capable of automated detection of novel behaviors in at least 1 area of compatibility. The demonstration will use naïve animals exposed to a DARPA-selected indication of interest.
    Month 14: Mid-term Phase II report documenting prototype adaptation to 1 area of compatibility, including architectures and algorithms; methods; results; comparisons with alternative methods; and quantification of accuracy, robustness, generalizability and demonstration outcomes. Report will include drafted instructions/manual for prototype users. Report will summarize planned commercial and government expansion efforts.
    Month 17: Interim report describing performance of system in second area of compatibility.
    Month 21: Demonstrate a prototype capable of automated detection of novel behaviors in at least 2 areas of compatibility. The demonstration will use naïve animals exposed to performer-selected indications of interest. Report quantifying system performance, comparing with alternative state-of-the art approaches using machine learning or other conventional methods, and documenting lessons learned.
    Month 23: Demonstrate a prototype capable of automated detection of novel behaviors in at least 2 areas of compatibility. The demonstration will use naïve animals exposed to a DARPA-selected indication of interest.
    Month 24: Final Phase II Report: Report will document the effort and include information required to transfer the technology to new users, including a complete user manual. The report will document information about the final prototype to include architectures and algorithms; methods; results; comparisons with alternative methods; and quantification of accuracy, robustness, generalizability and demonstration outcomes.

PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS

The proposed technology is intended to dramatically expand the utility of animal behavioral assays in both DoD and commercial markets. Within the DoD, Phase III will be targeted towards chemical and biological defense. Phase III funding should be obtained from either the private sector, a non-SBIR Government source, or both, and will be focused on formalizing/ establishing prototype products for direct transition into chemical threat assessment pipelines. Within the commercial markets, it is expected that technologies developed under this announcement will be directly applicable to the study of disease and drug development. Commercialization efforts for prototypes developed under this announcement will require funding from the private sector, OR a non-SBIR/STTR government source. Work will emphasize advanced development or refinement of technology towards an indication of interest or scaling of technology to accelerate data collection and provide competitive advantage to preclinical development pipelines.

DESCRIPTION

This SBIR XL topic seeks proposals for developing novel autonomy applications that enhance the capabilities of the UH-60 as an autonomous aerial platform for emergency services, with a specific initial focus in wildfire suppression. These applications will be developed utilizing DARPA ALIAS and the Sikorsky MATRIX Government Purpose Rights Software Development Kit to plug into the ALIAS autonomy stack to provide real-time decision-making, integrated sensing for situational awareness, and advanced communication technologies for coordination with ground and air units. The ALIAS-Texas initiative will assess the ability of autonomous/semi-autonomous aircraft to support wildland firefighting operations through simulated and live test environments, covering tasks such as water or retardant drops, cargo sling loads, medical evacuations, reconnaissance, and crew shuttles. A significant component of this project will be the development and integration of autonomy applications that enable these aircraft to perform complex tasks with minimal human intervention. The increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires necessitate advanced technologies for rapid response and suppression. Autonomous systems can significantly reduce response times and enhance the effectiveness of firefighting efforts. The ALIAS-Texas initiative aims to develop and integrate a suite of third-party autonomy applications that work with the MATRIX system to deliver enhanced optionally piloted vehicle (OPV) capabilities optimized for sustained concurrent/collaborative multi-vehicle wildland firefighting operations, with additional capabilities pertaining to emergency services. The focus on autonomy app development will enable these systems to perform complex tasks with minimal human intervention, improving their effectiveness and reliability in critical missions. This initiative will leverage the existing network between the ALIAS air vehicle autonomy program, and Sikorsky’s MATRIX autonomy system, combined with newly developed third-party autonomy applications to execute emergency services and wildland firefighting tasks, including the following:

    Cargo sling loads
    Water or retardant drops using buckets or a fixed tank
    Medical evacuations
    Reconnaissance
    Crew shuttles

Autonomy applications will be developed and tested using the Advanced Framework for Simulation, Integration, and Modeling (AFSIM) environment. The simulation will represent terrain, wind, vegetation, and fire dynamics and will support real-time interaction and observation through conformant sensor interfaces. Initial capabilities of autonomous aircraft will be demonstrated in a controlled environment. The initial focus will be on developing and testing autonomy applications that enable the aircraft to perform tasks such as search, localization, tracking, suppression, and assessment autonomously. Later phases of app development will expand the simulation environment to include real-world data. Field tests will be conducted with autonomous aircraft, demonstrating real-time decision-making and coordination with other emergency services. The system will be integrated with ground control, test operations, and data acquisition environments to support concurrent control of multiple ALIAS-enabled aircraft for one or multiple operations. The development of autonomy applications will continue, with a focus on enhancing the aircraft's ability to perform complex tasks autonomously and collaboratively. Field data will be used to validate and verify autonomy app development.

PHASE I

This SBIR topic is open to Direct-to-Phase II (DP2) proposals only. Offerors must demonstrate existing technical maturity and feasibility of their approach through preliminary results, app prototypes, or prior autonomy work. Proposals should clearly articulate their ability to integrate with a high-fidelity simulation environment (Generic Helicopter Model) for training, testing, and evaluation of their application, ALIAS/MATRIX autonomy and mission behaviors. A clear transition path to Phase II should be outlined, including existing modeling and simulation environments that would support the rapid development of autonomy applications to integrate with the ALIAS/MATRIX autonomy system.

PHASE II

Phase II efforts will focus on developing and demonstrating an operational prototype of the proposed application. Offerors will be expected to demonstrate the performance of their autonomy plugin through operationally realistic wildfire fighting mission scenarios. In Phase II (12Month Period of Performance), proposers will be expected to:

    Develop a functional prototype of their mission app integrated with ALIAS/MATRIX autonomy stack utilizing ALIAS/MATRIX SDK.
    Demonstrate performance in both simulation and live flight test, using S-76 and UH-60 optionally piloted helicopters
    Validate key app functionality through scenario-based evaluation.

Capstone scenario capabilities can be included in proposal Scenario examples:

    Single Aircraft: Fixed Burn Fire Suppression - Suppress a planned prescribed burn with automated drop planning and execution over a fixed area using wind and terrain aware routing.
    Single Aircraft: Rooftop Personnel Recovery - Recover injured personnel from a rooftop in an urban environment using autonomous landing or hover/hoist operations under emergency conditions
    Multi-Aircraft: Coordinated Wildfire Suppression - Recon and suppression aircraft operate together to identify firelines, relay targets, and coordinate drops for maximum containment effect.
    Single Aircraft: Cargo Sling Load - Deliver a sling-loaded supply payload from base to a forward area, autonomously managing load stability, airspeed, and LZ approach.
    Single Aircraft: Reconnaissance - Conduct an autonomous route or area recon using EO/IR sensors, tagging points of interest and generating a time stamped report.
    Single Aircraft: Crew Shuttle - Transport personnel between mission staging areas, dynamically updating routes and manifests based on C2 tasking or weather conditions.
    Participate in at least one government organized simulation exercise and one flight demonstration event to evaluate app performance in realistic operational conditions.

Option (12 Month Period of Performance): Additional app development for multi aircraft scenarios

    Expansion of app training, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) for tasking, mission monitoring, and dynamic reallocation across multiple aircraft and mission types.
    Refinement of airspace integration procedures to support mixed use operations in civil, military, and disaster response environments.
    Validation of TTPs for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) driven multi aircraft coordination without centralized ground control.
    Incorporation of tactical autonomy behaviors for mission adaptation in denied, degraded, or contested environments.
    Development of response TTPs for distributed autonomous teams.
    Collaboration with end-user organizations to tailor mission specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) and concepts of operations (CONOPS).
    Simulation and live testing of cross domain mission profiles, such as simultaneous fire suppression and reconnaissance, or search and rescue (SAR) with logistics delivery.

PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS

If successful, commercial applications include rapid response to wildfires and other natural disasters. Military applications include autonomous surveillance and reconnaissance in austere environments. The system will support a broad array of engineering, testing, and training, including AI app development, aircraft-sensor-app integration, and mission-based testing. The autonomy applications developed in this project will have broad applicability across various domains, with capability to enhance autonomous systems in both commercial and military settings.

DESCRIPTION

The U.S. Space Force (USSF), through organizations such as Task Force Futures (TF-F) and the Commercial Space Office (COMSO), plays a vital role in identifying, integrating, and accelerating emerging technologies with national security relevance. These entities are tasked with shaping future space capabilities by engaging commercial innovators, tracking science and technology (S&T) developments, and aligning public-private investment activities. However, these efforts are currently constrained by a fragmented and siloed data environment. There is no unified platform that allows Space Force stakeholders to maintain real-time situational awareness of national and global S&T trends, track venture and strategic capital flows, assess emerging technology trajectories, or retain institutional knowledge of industry interactions. The absence of such a platform creates persistent challenges, including:

- Disconnected and reactive industry engagement

- Redundant outreach efforts and repeated learning cycles

- Inefficient alignment of RDT&E priorities with commercial innovation activity

- Missed opportunities for strategic co-investment and transition

 

As the USSF moves toward greater commercial integration, there is a clear and urgent need for a mission-aligned, data-driven platform to consolidate insights across the S&T and investment landscape. This platform must bridge the gap between government demand signals and commercial capability supply—enabling more effective technology planning, improved transparency, and faster, more informed decision-making. Proposed solutions should address this strategic need by enabling:

- Holistic ecosystem visibility across companies, technologies, and investors while protecting access

- Deeper insight into innovation trajectories and private capital allocation

- Institutional knowledge capture to support continuity and repeatable strategy

- Scalable, modular tools that empower proactive co-investment planning

 

Ultimately, this capability is essential to help the Space Force move at the pace of innovation, deepen collaboration with non-traditional partners, and maintain U.S. technological advantage in an increasingly competitive space domain.

NOTE: To ask a question, you must log in or create an account for the DSIP.

Question Submitted On: 09/23/2025

Question:

It looks as though this contract will require CMMC2, since it includes ITAR data and CUI. If that's so, will a self-assessment and POAM be acceptable, or is C3PAO required at award acceptance?

Answer:

SBCs will need to complete the self-assessment of the NIST 800-171 compliance and upload their scores into the Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS). The resulting score will determine whether or not a POAM needs to be submitted to address any cybersecurity gaps. If a proposal is selected and a C3PAO is required, contracting will address that requirement with that given SBC but is not required to be submitted with the proposal package on DSIP. 

Question Submitted On: 09/18/2025

Question:

Given changing cybersecurity requirements, is there authoritative guidance on what NIST and CMMC standards must be met, and when? E.g., in terms of timing, which levels must be met at submission, by award, or by the end of the period of performance?

Answer:

Phased Implementation: The final CMMC rule (32 CFR 170) is in effect, and the DFARS clauses (48 CFR) take effect beginning November 10, 2025. Starting then, new contracts will begin including CMMC Level 1 or 2 requirements, with higher levels phased in over time. At Award: Where the CMMC DFARS clause is included, contractors must already meet the required CMMC level (either via self-assessment or third-party assessment, depending on level). If the level is not met, the offeror is ineligible for award.

Question Submitted On: 09/18/2025

Question:

The Topic and the Component Instructions seem to specify different maximum lengths for the proposal. Is it 10 pages or 25 for the Tech Volume?

Answer:

Per the component instructions listed on page 14, the Volume 2 Technical Volume Page Limit for this D2P2 SBIR topic is 15. The Volume 2 Technical Volume Page Limit can be found by selecting the “USAF” hyperlink under the Component Instructions column. 

Question Submitted On: 09/17/2025

Question:

Is a customer memorandum required for this D2P2 with a specific topic?

Answer:

No, the DAF AFWERX/SpaceWERX Customer Memorandum form is NOT a requirement for this topic. Currently, Customer Memorandum forms are required for Open Topic solicitations and not Specific Topic solicitations. Since this is a Specific Topic solicitation, this form is not a requirement. 

Question Submitted On: 09/08/2025

Question:

For a D2P2 proposal, what level of prior feasibility evidence is considered sufficient? Would a documented feasibility study with end-user validation and stakeholder commitment letter meet the requirement, or is a working prototype expected at the time of proposal?

Answer:

For a D2P2 proposal, sufficient feasibility evidence is defined by what was required and achieved in Phase I for the specific topic. A documented feasibility study—especially when supported by end-user validation and a stakeholder commitment letter—can meet this requirement if it clearly demonstrates technical merit and that feasibility was substantially established by the applicant/PI during Phase I. A fully working prototype is not generally required at the proposal stage, though having one can strengthen the submission. Ultimately, proposers should align their evidence with the Phase I topic description, as that governs the minimum standard for demonstrating feasibility under the solicitation.

Question Submitted On: 09/05/2025

Question:

Given that this topic has the ITAR designation, is there an additional document I need to submit in my proposal package?

Answer:

Yes, the DD 2345 Form MUST be submitted as a part of the proposal package. Small business must follow the “General Instructions DD Form 2345” at this hyperlink: https://www.dla.mil/Logistics-Operations/Services/JCP/DD23%2045Instructions/. This requirement and link is also listed in the “DoD SBIR 2025.4” Solicitation Instructions hyperlink on page 11 of the document or on page 15 out of 48 of the entire PDF document. Post any issues or questions with the DD 2345 Form on this Q&A Platform.

OBJECTIVE

The United States Space Force (USSF) seeks innovative solutions to develop and demonstrate a secure, adaptable software environment capable of ingesting, integrating, and analyzing high-volume, low-latency data streams from diverse space-based sources. This effort supports the Secure Multi-Source Data Fusion Environment for proliferated Low Earth Orbit (pLEO) Constellations topic and aims to deliver an extensible fusion platform that enables real-time situational awareness, advanced analytics, and dynamic mission adaptability across the Department of Defense’s Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA).

 

Proposed solutions must support the integration of heterogeneous data types, enable rapid onboarding of new sensors and analytics tools, and facilitate secure, sandboxed evaluation of AI/ML-driven capabilities. The environment should be designed to enforce zero-trust security principles, maintain strict access controls and data sovereignty, and operate seamlessly across both physical and cloud-based infrastructures.

 

The architecture should allow for continuous scaling to accommodate growing mission needs, multi-vendor participation, and potential expansion to multi-level security environments and coalition operations. Priority will be given to solutions that enhance latency-sensitive decision-making, promote tool reusability, and align with SDA’s broader objectives for resilient and interoperable battle management.

 

Ultimately, this effort will empower USSF and SDA to accelerate technology evaluation, reduce stovepiped workflows, and improve operational responsiveness across the evolving space enterprise.

ITAR

The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.

DESCRIPTION

The United States Space Force (USSF), through the Space Development Agency (SDA), is leading the development and deployment of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA)—a threat-driven, resilient constellation of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) that delivers global sensing and secure data transport at operational scale. At the heart of the PWSA is the Battle Management, Command, Control, and Communications (BMC3) Layer, which is responsible for enabling real-time tasking, automated decision-making, and timely kill chain execution in support of joint warfighter operations.

 

While various data fusion tools exist, few are designed to meet the scale, velocity, and multi-vendor integration demands of PWSA. This topic seeks innovative solutions to develop and demonstrate a secure, modular, and extensible data fusion environment tailored to pLEO constellations and their evolving operational contexts. Proposed capabilities may include, but are not limited to:

- Real-time ingestion and fusion of diverse live or simulated data streams from PWSA assets

- Hosting AI/ML-driven analytics for mission applications such as anomaly detection, threat identification, and predictive situational awareness

- Establishing a secure sandbox framework to evaluate third-party tools in isolated environments with integrity and traceability

- Implementing zero-trust security principles, robust access controls, and data sovereignty enforcement to maintain resilience and continuity of operations

 

Solutions should be deployable in both cloud-based and on-premise environments, with a focus on core fusion infrastructure and sandbox functionality. Proposed architectures must enable rapid integration of new data sources, support future scalability to multi-level security and coalition use cases, and preserve government control over mission-sensitive data and tool access. This topic directly supports SDA’s goal to enhance data-to-decision agility, accelerate tool evaluation, and enable a responsive, vendor-agnostic space mission architecture.

PHASE I

This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:

    Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the USAF and/or USSF need(s).
    Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.
    Describe if and how the solution can be used by other U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) or Governmental customers.

PHASE II

Phase II will focus on developing and demonstrating a secure, extensible data fusion environment tailored for deployment within a multi-vendor proliferated Low Earth Orbit (pLEO) constellation. This environment must support real-time integration of diverse data streams, scalable analytics, and secure third-party tool evaluation within a modular framework that aligns with future SDA and PWSA mission needs. Key deliverables may include:

- A functioning data fusion environment capable of ingesting and integrating at least two live or representative data streams in real time

- AI/ML-driven analytics addressing at least two operationally relevant use cases (e.g., anomaly detection, threat correlation, or predictive awareness)

- Full documentation of system architecture, onboarding procedures, and implemented security controls

- A secure, vendor-isolated sandbox environment for onboarding and evaluating third-party analytic tools, including the successful demonstration of at least one tool under auditability and strong isolation constraints

- Demonstration of deployed infrastructure (virtualized and/or physical) supporting the fusion environment

- Established performance benchmarks, along with a transition and scalability plan outlining how the solution can expand to incorporate additional data feeds, new analytic capabilities, and integration with coalition partners and multi-level security domains

 

Additionally, the Phase II effort will include implementation of robust access control mechanisms and zero-trust policy enforcement to ensure operational continuity, data sovereignty, and mission assurance in support of SDA’s broader strategic objectives.

PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS

Phase III efforts will focus on operationalizing, scaling, and transitioning the secure multi-source data fusion environment for proliferated Low Earth Orbit (pLEO) constellations into both government and commercial use. This includes maturing the platform to:

- Integrate additional and more complex data streams from diverse sources

- Expand support for multi-vendor access controls and third-party tool onboarding

- Enhance zero-trust security frameworks and policy enforcement mechanisms based on Phase II operational feedback

- Strengthen resilience, auditability, and interoperability with existing government systems

 

Additionally, Phase III will explore the commercialization potential of the architecture, including the delivery of classified innovation environments as a service to other U.S. government agencies and trusted industry partners. These secure sandboxes would enable rapid onboarding and evaluation of analytics tools and mission applications while maintaining strict data sovereignty and security compliance. The overarching objective is to transition the prototype into a sustainable, widely adopted capability that supports dynamic mission needs, accelerates vendor innovation, and offers scalable value across the national security space enterprise and adjacent commercial markets.

Question:

Will evaluation of the fusion environment include consideration for operator interaction models, i.e., such as human-in-the-loop decision support, cognitive load reduction, or explainable visualizations, in addition to purely technical performance metrics?

Answer:
Response Pending

Question Submitted On: 09/24/2025

Question:

As Tranche deployments spiral every two years, does the government envision the fusion environment requiring backward compatibility with prior versions of NEBULA/OCT, or is forward-compatibility (supporting only the most recent standards) the baseline expectation for proposal evaluation?

Answer:
Response Pending

Question Submitted On: 09/24/2025

Question:

    On Explainability and Trust: Does the government want analytic outputs in the fusion environment to include source-contribution attribution (i.e., which data streams influenced a given analytic decision), or are aggregate scores sufficient for mission assurance?

     

    On Adversarial Threats: In addition to evaluating vendor tools in an isolated sandbox, will proposals be evaluated on resilience to adversarial attacks (e.g., poisoned data ingestion, timing-based telemetry manipulation) at the fusion layer?

     

    On Coalition Operations: When considering multi-level security and coalition data sharing, should solutions emphasize deterministic policy enforcement (strict rulesets) or adaptive downgrading pipelines that preserve utility while controlling risk?

     

    On Cryptographic Controls: Does Space Force expect vendors to address the role of post-quantum identity assurance or cryptographic provenance tracking in enforcing data sovereignty within the fusion environment?

     
    On Sandbox Governance: Is the intent for the sandbox to operate purely as a technical isolation mechanism, or does the government also expect integrated governance… such as trust scoring, red-teaming of analytic outputs, or provenance-based validation?

Answer:
Response Pending

Question Submitted On: 09/15/2025

Question:

    What do the data streams look like coming in in either the most basic or typical scenario?
        Is the data stream:
            Using a format like Kafka, MQTT, Websockets or unspecified where we can/should help shape the requirement?
            What are some of the specific types of data we should expect to work with? JSON, CSV, AVRO, images, RTSP etc?
            Expected to serve tens / hundreds / thousands etc. of messages per second (at peak expected load)?
            Containing messages in the bytes / KB / MB size range?
        Are they primarily:
            Telemetry data regarding the physical status of the hardware in question (e.g. temperature, sensor integrity, location / heading data etc.)?
            Updates on the functionality / capability of the system (e.g. bandwidth, ping time, packet loss etc.)?
            Realtime video / image streams? (having a large or small content of image / video data will significantly alter the required architecture and data storage costs) 
            Realtime updates for SITMAP / COP layers?
            AKA: what is the rough idea of the data models we’d be working with?
        If there is a significant image / video processing component of the incoming data streams:
            Are the images / videos labelled / annotated or is it a raw image file where the SBC will be expected to perform analysis of the images / video frames during data ingestion?
            Are the images / videos given stitched together (panorama-esque) or standalone and is the SBC expected to perform image stitching?
    What are some examples of the third party analytic tools that the SBC might have to support in their sandbox environment?
    Is the platform developed by the SBC expected to provide an outbound data stream as well or only perform ingestion, fusion, storage and analytics?
    Will the selected SBC be receiving a sandbox environment, data schema / format information, or mock data representative of what we’d expect to see in production systems?
    Will the development process potentially involve re-scoping feature requirements mid project?
    What is the rough timeframe for SBCs’ proposals to be evaluated and the subsequent project start date?

OBJECTIVE

The United States Space Force (USSF), through the Space Development Agency (SDA), is seeking innovative solutions to mature key technologies that enable commercial De-Orbit as a Service (DaaS) capabilities for proliferated Low Earth Orbit (pLEO) satellite constellations. As the Department of Defense’s (DoD) Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) continues to expand, there is a need for safe, scalable, and responsive satellite disposal mechanisms—particularly for satellites that experience mission-ending anomalies and cannot autonomously de-orbit.

 

Rather than fielding bespoke government solutions, SDA aims to catalyze a commercially sustainable market for DaaS by investing in maturing subsystems necessary for future on-orbit servicing. This topic seeks to prototype and validate technologies that reduce technical and operational risks for DaaS offerings and establish a foundation for future on-orbit demonstration missions. Proposed solutions may include, but are not limited to:

- Validation of rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) technologies such as sensors, vision-based navigation, and autonomous maneuver planning in simulated or lab-based environments

- Demonstration of universal capture mechanisms compatible with multiple PWSA bus types, leveraging modular and non-invasive design principles

- Evaluation of collision avoidance and trajectory planning techniques through high-fidelity software simulations

- Design recommendations for future PWSA spacecraft that improve serviceability and reduce integration friction with DaaS providers

 

Proposals should focus on developing capabilities that can be commercialized and integrated into a broader orbital debris mitigation and satellite servicing ecosystem. A successful effort will reduce the timeline for fielding U.S.-based DaaS capabilities and improve long-term resilience, safety, and sustainability in LEO.

The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items. Offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the statement of work (SOW) tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s) in accordance with section 3.5 of the Announcement. Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.

DESCRIPTION

The United States Space Force (USSF), through the Space Development Agency (SDA), is leading the development and deployment of the Department of Defense’s (DoD) Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA)—a resilient, scalable constellation of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) designed to provide global military sensing and data transport. As PWSA deployment advances, some satellites will inevitably experience end-of-life anomalies, such as propulsion failures or loss of communications, that prevent safe, controlled de-orbiting.

 

Rather than developing bespoke government capabilities, the USSF and SDA intend to leverage commercial De-Orbit as a Service (DaaS) offerings to remove defunct PWSA satellites and reduce long-term orbital debris risks. Recent 120-day vendor studies have identified areas that must be addressed before DaaS operations can be safely proceed on-orbit. This topic seeks to mature and prototype enabling technologies through focused ground testing and risk-reduction efforts, including:

- Validating rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) technologies—such as sensors, autonomy software, and computer vision algorithms—through lab-based tests

- Demonstrating universal capture mechanisms compatible with multiple PWSA bus designs using hardware testbeds or robotic systems

- Evaluating collision-avoidance strategies using high-fidelity simulations to assess response accuracy, decision logic, and maneuver safety

- Recommending satellite design enhancements that simplify future servicing, including passive aids or standardized interface features

 

This effort supports USSF and SDA’s broader objective of enabling a commercially viable, scalable U.S. DaaS ecosystem capable of supporting both defense and commercial pLEO operators. Solutions should reduce technology risk, inform future demonstrations, and contribute to long-term space sustainability.

PHASE I

This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:

    Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the USAF and/or USSF need(s).
    Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.
    Describe if and how the solution can be used by other U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) or Governmental customers.

PHASE II

Phase II will focus on maturing enabling technologies that support commercial De-Orbit as a Service (DaaS) operations for the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA). The goal of this phase is to conduct extensive ground testing and prototyping to reduce technical and operational risks associated with on-orbit DaaS missions. Key technology development areas may include:

- Validation of rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) capabilities through laboratory testing of sensors, guidance software, and computer vision algorithms

- Development and demonstration of universal capture system prototypes compatible with multiple PWSA bus interfaces via hardware testbeds or robotic arms

- High-fidelity simulation of collision-avoidance tactics, including autonomous maneuvering logic and fail-safe protocols

- Engineering recommendations to make future PWSA satellites more “service-friendly,” such as standardized grappling features or interface aids

 

Key deliverables for Phase II may include:

- Comprehensive test reports summarizing lab demonstrations, hardware testing, and simulation outcomes

- A detailed technical risk assessment, showing how the proposed technologies reduce hazards and increase reliability for future on-orbit use

- A draft on-orbit demonstration plan, identifying a suitable PWSA asset, required spacecraft interfaces, operational concept, and success criteria

- A draft commercialization strategy, outlining how the technology can transition into a scalable DaaS offering post-demonstration

 

This phase is intended to bridge the gap between concept and flight demonstration, laying the technical foundation necessary for future SDA mission integration and broader commercial viability.

PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS

Phase III will focus on transitioning the de-orbit demonstration capability into a fully operational, commercially viable De-Orbit-as-a-Service (DaaS) offering. This effort aims to support both government and commercial proliferated Low Earth Orbit (pLEO) constellations with scalable, on-demand end-of-life satellite disposal solutions Phase III/Dual use may include:

- Scaling the validated technology from Phase II into an operational system capable of servicing a broader set of satellite platforms and customers

- Establishing strategic partnerships with commercial satellite operators, launch providers, and ground segment infrastructure to enable full-service DaaS delivery

- Standing up ground operations centers (as needed) to support mission planning, tasking, and RPO control

- Refining the business model and pricing structure to ensure sustainable return on investment (ROI) within 3–5 years post-service launch

- Addressing regulatory, licensing, and safety requirements, including compliance with orbital debris mitigation standards and coordination with global space traffic management entities

 

Phase III activities should demonstrate the ability to execute routine de-orbit operations with high reliability and responsiveness, enabling a new commercial capability aligned with both U.S. Space Force and global space sustainability goals. This capability will help mitigate collision risks, reduce long-term debris growth, and enhance the resilience of current and future pLEO architectures.

OBJECTIVE

The United States Space Force, through the Space Development Agency (SDA), seeks to develop an adaptive, knowledge-guided test-planning capability to serve as a decision aid in support of Test & Evaluation (T&E) activities for the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA). PWSA is a continuously evolving constellation in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) designed to deliver resilient, threat-responsive capabilities to the joint force. Given the rapid, tranche-based deployment of capabilities under SDA’s spiral development model, traditional compliance-based test strategies are insufficient. This effort aims to prototype a modern test framework that can:

- Continuously update understanding of system performance using real-time test data

- Quantify expected knowledge gain relative to resource cost for each test

- Dynamically re-plan test sequences to prioritize high-utility activities and truncate low-value ones

 

The solution should incorporate probabilistic reasoning (e.g., Bayesian inference), integration of synthetic and live test data, and multi-objective utility models aligned with mission priorities (e.g., latency, resiliency, throughput). It should also support open APIs and modular architecture to ensure compatibility with SDA's digital infrastructure. Ultimately, this capability will enable smarter, faster, and more resource-efficient test campaigns that support the operational agility of the PWSA and its expanding mission scope.

ITAR

The technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items.

DESCRIPTION

The United States Space Force, through the Space Development Agency (SDA), is responsible for orchestrating the development and fielding of the Department of Defense’s Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA)—a resilient, threat-driven constellation of sensing and data transport satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Built on a spiral development model, PWSA is deployed in two-year tranches, requiring a flexible and adaptive approach to Test and Evaluation (T&E) that aligns with rapid acquisition timelines and continuous operational deployment. This topic seeks innovative solutions that adapt and extend test planning frameworks to support dynamic T&E activities for proliferated LEO architectures like PWSA. Solutions of interest should leverage knowledge-guided, sequential test planning methods capable of:

- Continuously updating knowledge of system performance as test outcomes are collected

- Quantifying the expected knowledge gain relative to test cost or resource usage

- Dynamically re-planning test sequences to focus on high-value activities while truncating low-yield or redundant tests

 

Of particular interest are solutions incorporating Bayesian probability theory to integrate priors, synthetic data, and live test results into an evolving, uncertainty-aware knowledge base that informs future test selections. The intent is to enable smarter and more agile test planning that can prioritize the most impactful test actions based on evolving system knowledge and operational priorities. Proposed solutions should demonstrate clear applicability to the unique demands of SDA's rapid and iterative space acquisition model and facilitate integration into evolving digital infrastructure for space system development and validation.

PHASE I

This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, Phase I awards will not be made for this topic. The applicant is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a “Phase I-type” effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-mission fit between the proposed solution and a potential U.S. Air Force (USAF) and/or USSF stakeholder. The applicant should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the U.S. Department of Air Force (DAF) customer and end-user. The feasibility study should have:

    Clearly identified the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the USAF and/or USSF need(s).
    Described the pathway to integrating with DAF operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant systems and/or processes.
    Describe if and how the solution can be used by other U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) or Governmental customers.

PHASE II

Phase II will focus on maturing a knowledge-guided, sequential test planning framework and tailoring it to the unique challenges of proliferated Low Earth Orbit (pLEO) architectures, such as the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA). The objective is to transition a prototype capability into an operationally relevant tool that can support adaptive, data-informed Test and Evaluation (T&E) activities across SDA's evolving satellite constellations. Key activities may include:

    Adapting an existing prototype framework to the PWSA T&E environment:
        Evolve the sequential test-planning core—Bayesian or equivalent—by calibrating priors, likelihoods, and multi-objective utility functions to reflect key performance parameters (KPPs) such as latency, resiliency, and throughput.
        Define open APIs and data models in collaboration with SDA stakeholders and subject matter experts to ensure interoperability with existing and future digital systems.
        Architect a containerized, microservices-based toolkit capable of ingesting live and synthetic PWSA data, updating probabilistic models, computing utility, and recommending next-best test actions.
    Use case development and scenario selection:
        Collaborate with SDA to identify and refine 3–4 representative test scenarios (e.g., cross-link validation, latency testing, or constellation coverage verification).
        Assemble and curate synthetic or surrogate datasets to support development and evaluation.
    Prototype demonstration and refinement:
        Integrate the solution with a representative digital or hardware-in-the-loop environment.
        Conduct live evaluations, collect stakeholder feedback, and refine the capability accordingly.
    Transition planning and documentation:
        Produce detailed documentation including system architecture, technical design, user guides, API references, and training materials.
        Develop a phased rollout plan outlining the strategy for transition into broader use across SDA's operational framework.

The successful Phase II outcome will be a validated and adaptable test planning capability that aligns with SDA’s agile acquisition model and delivers measurable value in supporting performance assurance across rapidly deployed satellite systems.

PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS

Phase III will focus on transitioning the adaptive, decision-centric test planning capability into operational use across the Space Development Agency’s (SDA) Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) and other proliferated Low Earth Orbit (pLEO) constellations. The effort will continue maturing the prototype into a production-grade capability that supports real-time test planning, dynamic resource optimization, and performance validation across government and commercial mission contexts. Key activities may include:

- Operational Integration: Scale the system architecture and performance to support persistent test and evaluation across live SDA systems and ground infrastructure. Integrate seamlessly with SDA’s digital backbone, data pipelines, and command and control systems.

- Decision Support at Scale: Expand the decision-aid framework to support concurrent test campaigns across multiple mission areas, dynamically allocating resources and test focus based on utility analysis and evolving knowledge.

- Commercialization & Broader Transition: Adapt the capability for commercial space operators deploying pLEO constellations or operating in agile mission environments. Demonstrate interoperability with other DoD agencies and potential coalition partners to support joint operations.

- Sustainment & ROI: Establish mechanisms for system sustainment, support, and iterative refinement based on user feedback. Develop scalable licensing or deployment models to enable long-term use and return on investment.

 

The overarching goal of Phase III is to deliver a robust, flexible, and operationally embedded test planning capability that strengthens mission assurance, reduces cost and timeline burdens for system validation, and provides a foundation for continuous improvement of space-based sensing and transport networks.

 Question Submitted On: 09/26/2025

Question:

Is the intent of the test and evaluation to support ground vehicle testing (vibration, functional, performance, etc) prior to launch or is it for assets on-orbit? 

Answer:
Response Pending

Question Submitted On: 09/15/2025

Question:

    Can you please confirm our understanding that we are creating a test suite platform that dictates which sequence order the “on vehicle” tests should be run. If so, do tests have different importance scores (e.g. latency testing more important than constellation coverage verification)?
    Is the T&E framework something that needs to have capabilities beyond system monitoring? Is it expected to perform alerting, feed data into another system etc.?
    What are the expected results from the tests?
        What are the potential types of incoming data? RTSP, AVRO, CSV etc.?
        Will the data models be provided in order for us to create synthetic data or can we expect to be given labelled historic data to use for benchmarking evaluation models?
        Will the SBC be expected to create a data simulation tool that mimics the specific test failure modes (i.e. starting with high level alerts from the system and then providing subsequent relevant fine-grained alerts which can then either self-heal or persist)?
        Given a failed test what are the expected actions? External notifications / dashboard alerts? Prescriptive actions (i.e. attempt to resolve issues by sending a command to reboot or similar)?
    Will we be writing the tests (or test scenarios) ourselves or will they be given to us, or both?
    Are we expecting integration of new test types as the pLEO program continues to develop?
    Will the selected SBC be receiving a sandbox environment, data schema / format information, or mock data representative of what we’d expect to see in production systems?
    Will the development process potentially involve re-scoping feature requirements mid project and if so, to what extent?
    What is the rough timeframe for SBCs’ proposals to be evaluated and the subsequent project start date?

Answer:

    The aim is to build an enterprise-of-enterprise level (Tranche agnostic) T&E decision support tool. This tool would support the PWSA integrated testing campaigns (integrated across CT/DT/OT where feasible) to push delivery to the Warfighter as far left in the schedule as possible. Stated differently, the tool supports answering the question at key decision points: are the gains in confidence and certainly of continued testing worth the cost and schedule? If not, what testing/retesting and in what sequence to we need to get to that point. Yes, this will involve sequence of testing/retesting, optimization of test sequence towards decision points. We will need to factor in test prioritization schema. 
    Although not discussed in the solicitation, the tool providing an alert on a failed test would be ideal. No, the tool is not expected feed into another system.
    Offeror is expected to provide their own test data for this Phase II. Expected results will depend on the solutions developed by the Offeror. Regarding 3.4, Need clarification. A failed test, meaning a test that failed to execute (not a successfully executed test that resulted in a “fail” rating) should involve an alert of some capacity. No prescriptive actions
    Offeror is expected to author the test scenarios, using a collaborative process with SDA to define those scenarios.
    Need clarity on what is meant by “new test types”. However, in general, SDA leaves open opportunity to ensure we can rapidly adapt to changing needs and priorities.  As PWSA continues to proliferate and evolve to meet Warfighter need, SDA intendeds to introduce new test events, test needs, changing priorities etc… as the system and Warfighter priority evolves.
    No.
    To provide a direct answer, yes; that is a possibility. While we would like to say we’ll get it right from the start, the reality is we are very early in the deployment of PWSA. Thus, our understanding of the problem and solution features may change.   We don’t know the unknown unknowns yet and look forward to working with Performers who are willing to get figure this out with us. 
    Per the solicitation instructions on page 19 or on page 23 out of 48 of the entire PDF file, “Proposing SBCs will be notified of selection or non-selection status for an award by the DoD Service/Component that originated the topic no later than 90 days of the closing date for this BAA.” These solicitation instruction can be located by selecting the “DoD SBIR 2025.4” hyperlink.

OBJECTIVE

The United States Space Force (USSF) is seeking innovative solutions to inform the future of autonomous, resilient, and intelligent space operations through the Futures Series: Adaptive and Intelligent Space (AIS) Challenge—a strategic initiative led by Task Force Futures in partnership with SpaceWERX. This topic invites proposals that investigate the technical and operational feasibility of emerging space concepts and dual-use technologies capable of supporting coordinated satellite operations across Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Geostationary Orbit (GEO), eXtended GEO (XGEO), and the cislunar environment.

 

In Phase I, offerors should focus on early-stage research activities—including literature reviews, modeling and simulation, trade space analyses, and university or non-profit research collaborations—to lay the groundwork for prototype or proof of concept demonstrations to be developed in a potential future Phase II. This exploration phase is intended to reduce risk, validate feasibility, and refine mission alignment before committing to integrated technology demonstrations. Objectives include:

 

1. Explore novel concepts and architectures that support enhanced autonomy, survivability, and responsiveness in degraded or adversarial space environments.
2. Assess the feasibility of onboard edge intelligence, predictive threat analytics, and autonomous decision-making systems suitable for bandwidth-limited or contested conditions.
3. Analyze modular, scalable systems—including sensor payloads, computing elements, and spacecraft buses—that can adapt to evolving missions and orbital domains.
4. Develop preliminary Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) aligned with future USSF mission needs and evaluate potential integration paths with Space Force operational constructs.

 

Proposals should clearly define their Phase I scope, research methods, and collaboration plan with a research institution. While transition and commercialization planning are not the primary focus of Phase I, proposers should briefly articulate how the work could inform a Phase II prototype or proof-of-concept demonstration and support longer-term mission relevance.

The Adaptive and Intelligent Space (AIS) Challenge addresses foundational gaps in how space-based assets are allocated, coordinated, and managed under contested and communication-degraded conditions.

 

The objective of this Phase I effort is to investigate the scientific, operational, and engineering feasibility of novel technologies supporting space control and battle management, with the goal of improving autonomous behavior, real-time responsiveness, and adaptability in orbital environments including LEO, GEO, XGEO, and cislunar space. Offerors are encouraged to propose early-stage research concepts that address one or more of the following focus areas. All work should include collaboration with a qualified research institution, and clearly define the technical approach, scope of analysis, and expected outcomes of a successful Phase I study: 

 

1. Edge Computing & Algorithms: Investigate edge processing architectures and AI/ML algorithms that can operate onboard spacecraft, enabling autonomous, low-latency decision-making in support of space domain awareness and battle management. This topic area should improve the ability to autonomously manage space activities, and improve the ability to autonomously fuse, process, and filter data from multiple sources and sensors. Desired capabilities may include:
- Technical feasibility of onboard threat analytics
- Architectures for resilient, secure, and radiation-tolerant edge computing
- Methods for reducing kill-chain latency by at least 50% and operator workload by at least 25%
- Potential test environments (digital or orbital) for future validation
- Discrimination in contested environments including resilience to data poisoning, sensor degradation, obfuscation, high noise
Desired technologies may include: 
- Predictive threat analytics and orchestrated response
- Thermal management and radiation-hardened solutions for edge and next-gen processing technologies (e.g. neuromorphic)  
- Data security
- Agile and assured use of high-partition data
- High-partition data agility and balanced software/AI integration 
- Anomaly or maneuver detection AI/ML algorithms and SDA data processing with high throughput
- Tip & Cue capability between SDA and satellite coordination functions 
- Memory-safe language applications for autonomy
- Improved ‘do-no-harm’ software for Autonomous Rendezvous and Proximity Operations
- Zero-trust for on-board computation methods
- Data compression algorithms
- Simulation of SDA data to improve training of robust maneuver detection models

2. Sensors Payloads: Explore modular sensor payload concepts with integrated processing that support multi-modal detection, threat characterization, and real-time insight generation. Emphasis should be placed on adaptability across mission profiles and orbital regimes. This topic area should improve the ability of the USSF to monitor, characterize, and maintain custody of space objects for a comprehensive sight picture. Desired capabilities may consider: 
- Integrated sensor-computing packages for persistent tracking
- Techniques for novel SDA collection and data fusion
- Higher fidelity persistent space object custody
- Attribute in-space actions across multiple collection spectra (including visible, IR, RF, LiDAR) 
- Solutions for software-defined or reconfigurable payloads

Desired technologies may include: 
- Passive RF, LIDAR, radar, IR, hyperspectral sensors
- HPC-S (high-performance computing at the sensor)
- Space-based sensing concepts suitable for GEO, XGEO, and cislunar

 

3. Bus Design: Assess spacecraft bus concepts that are modular, autonomously managed, and designed for mission flexibility and lifecycle extension. This topic area should enable improved integration of the prior two topics for advanced sensing and computing capabilities. Desired capabilities include: 
- Hardware modularity to allow rapid integration of emerging technology
- Software modularity to allow integration of autonomous capabilities 
- Reconfigurability across mission profiles and unexpected orbit transfers
- All-of-vehicle (bus and payload) autonomous optimization
- Autonomous load-shedding method to maintain mission operation and payload prioritization under duress
- Autonomous maneuver for collision avoidance
Desired technologies may include: 
- Architectures enabling lifecycle extension

- Bus platforms designed to adapt to technological change without re-architecture
- Integration-ready design for sensors, compute, and maneuver systems
- Highly maneuverable design to include high-delta V, thermal management, and on-board power systems capable of running edge-computing capability

 

Proposals must emphasize technical feasibility and clearly outline a Phase I research plan that includes modeling, simulation, literature review, or trade studies. While a Phase II transition concept may be outlined, Phase I deliverables are expected to focus on a feasibility study detailing USSF CONOPS and technical viability, as well as analytical findings, and early validation in collaboration with a university or research partner.

 

ANNEX I: Guidelines for CONOPS development and Feasibility Study
The Concept of Operations (CONOPS) should clearly communicate how the technology is intended to support a military mission within a defined system. The main purpose of the CONOPS is to facilitate a common understanding of a future system to help develop operational and system-level requirements. CONOPS should be written at the system level first and then expanded on how the technology functions enable successful military operations. The CONOPS needs to include, at a minimum: 
- The USSF mission and the mission military objectives
- The problem being addressed by the technology in the context of the mission (e.g., existing capability gap)
- (preferred) An operational overview diagram along with supporting text
- (preferred) A system architecture overview diagram with all the elements needed to accomplish the mission to include
- Integration-ready design for sensors, computing, and maneuver systems

 

Operating Concept to Technology: Space Control and Battle Management are supported through total Space Domain Awareness. The first imperative is achieving persistent, predictive, and precise Space Domain Awareness (SDA). SDA must encompass not only tracking and characterization of objects in orbit, but also attribution of intent, behavioral analysis, and predictive targeting. This requires integration across commercial sensors, alongside AI-driven decision aids and real-time orbital maneuver detection.  

 

Feasibility Study: 
A feasibility study is an assessment of the practicality of developing and implementing a new technology within a given concept. The study aims to objectively and rationally uncover the strengths and weaknesses of the new technology, the feasibility of successful development of the technology, and the viability of the success of implementation of the technology in the proposed CONOPS. The study should: 
- Identify the benefits of the new technology within the CONOPS over existing solutions (or lack thereof)
- Identify the risks, uncertainties/unknowns, and issues of the proposed CONOPS with mitigation and closure measures
- Identify the critical technology elements (CTEs) of the new technology
- Provide data to support the feasibility of technology development of each CTE to include: literature research supporting technical viability or historical usage, trade studies identifying existing technologies, current developments, and/or feasible development pathways, analysis demonstrating technical solutions, and heritage usage of similar technology with identified differences in operations and/or environment for proposed CONOPS. 

PHASE I

Phase I should focus on developing a feasibility study detailing a technically sound solution to a USSF capability need.  This can include evaluating the technical and operational feasibility of a proposed concept within one or more of the specified AIS technology focus areas: edge computing and algorithms, sensor payloads, or bus design. Offerors must develop an initial Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and conduct foundational studies to assess the viability, relevance, and potential impact of the proposed technology in future contested space environments. (See Annex I for guidelines on Feasibility study development and CONOPS in the Topic Description). The Phase I proposal will not exceed 15 pages in length. Efforts under Phase I may include:

 

- Literature reviews and state-of-the-art assessments
- Modeling, simulation, or analytical studies to explore performance, scalability, and mission relevance
- Preliminary architecture definitions and technology trade space analysis
- Operational use case development, mapped to current or projected Space Force mission needs
- Identification of technical risks and mitigation strategies

 

Offerors must clearly describe how the effort will:
- Leverage the capabilities and domain expertise of the affiliated research institution
- Advance the small business’s internal research and development (IR&D) toward a defensible technical approach
- Inform a future Phase II prototype or proof-of-concept demonstration effort, including early thoughts on transition, testability, and alignment with Space Force capability development priorities

 

This topic modifies the traditional SBIR/STTR Phase I process, with an event called the Adaptive and Intelligent Space (AIS) Phase I Showcase serving as the basis for Phase II selection.

 

Phase I Deliverables and Milestones:
Phase I deliverables include an initial report, a documented feasibility assessment, initial CONOPS and architectural framework, a proposed Phase II development plan (including scope, goals, and transition relevance), the final report and the most critical deliverable is the required documentation for the AIS Phase I Showcase. This event will occur near the end of the Phase I Period of Performance (PoP). All Phase I applicants must include the AIS Phase I Showcase in their proposal milestone schedules, and all awards made under this topic will include the AIS Phase I Showcase as a contract deliverable. The following documentation must be submitted at the showcase (not as part of the initial Phase I proposal submission):
- Proposal Cover Sheet (Volume 1)
- Technical Volume (Maximum 5 pages) (Volume 2)
- Cost Volume (Volume 3)
- Company Commercialization Report (Volume 4)
- Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Training (Volume 6) 
- Disclosures of Foreign Affiliations (Volume 7)
- Presentation Slide Deck (a maximum of 10 slides that includes summary information from the required volume sections listed above)

 

Note, the AIS Phase I showcase will constitute the Phase I awardees’ Phase II proposal submission. No separate Phase II proposal will be requested. Applicants will be provided more specific submission information as part of their Phase I award instructions.

 

Travel Considerations: 
The AIS Phase I Showcase will take place in El Segundo, CA, near the end of the Phase I PoP. Companies may include the cost of travel for up to two individuals in their Phase I budget to attend this event. The applicant/awardee is responsible for any transportation costs related to any additional individuals that attend this event.

The above-mentioned artifacts and the showcase presentation will constitute the Phase II proposal submission for purposes of the Phase II award decision. Phase II awardees will be determined based on the documentation submitted and the material presented during the AIS Phase I Showcase.

PHASE II

The Phase II shall focus on the development and demonstration of a functional prototype— or proof-of-concept demonstration-- software, hardware, or integrated systems—based on the feasibility studies and CONOPS defined in Phase I. This work should build on the small business's internal R&D, reduce technology development risk, and support alignment with future Space Force mission concepts. The prototypes or proof-of-concept demonstration should address specific operational challenges identified within the AIS Challenge’s three core focus areas: Edge Computing & Algorithms, Sensor Payloads, and Bus Design.

Question Submitted On: 09/24/2025

Question:

For topic 2, Sensors Payload, the solicitation mentions RF, LIDAR, radar, IR, hyperspectral. Is there interest in characterization of charged particles from an artificial source  vs environmental plasma? 

Answer:
Response Pending

Question Submitted On: 09/24/2025

Question:

We realize that this question has been asked before, so apologize for bringing it up again. The solicitation instruction states that “Technical volumes submitted under this topic have a page/slide limit of 15 pages”.  However, the Air Force STTR instructions also go on to state that “The Phase I Technical Volume page/slide limits identified for the topics do not include the Cover Sheet, Cost Volume, Cost Volume Itemized Listing (a-h)". Does the guidance - "5 pages will account for everything else such as the cover page, table of contents, and the glossary" - provided during the Ask-me-anything and a previous response to a similar question, override the DAF STTR instructions?

Answer:

Previously, it was mentioned that the Technical Volume Page Limit includes the Table of Contents, Glossary, and any other supporting documents for this Phase I STTR effort. However, proposers only need to include these sections for Phase II or Direct-to-Phase-II proposals but not for Phase I proposals like the Adaptive and Intelligent Space (AIS) STTR Phase I topic.
